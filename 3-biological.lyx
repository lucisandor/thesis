Skeletal muscle histology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Muscles are specialized for their main ability, contractility.
 For mammalians, ability to move is vital for survival, meaning that a large
 portion of their bodies is muscle.
 In a cohort of 300 borderline overweight US Americans, skeletal muscle
 as a proportion of body weight was on average 41% for men and 31% for women
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 Owing to the ability to measure individual muscles in any experiment, the
 scientific community has not been under pressure to develop accurate techniques
 that measure total skeletal muscle mass in mice.
 A proxy measure of murine skeletal muscle mass, lean body mass averaged
 81% of total body weight in adult males (detailed in results section).
 Three fifths of the human body's protein is confined to the muscle contractile
 and support structures

\begin_layout Standard
For the most part, the skeletal muscles confers the three-dimensional intricate
 conformation of the body, suggesting a complex, detailed organization,
 at least at macroscopic level.
 In contrast, at cell level, the relatively high specialization of the skeletal
 muscle leaves little space for diversity or inhomogeneity.
 Skeletal muscles are organized in anatomical units that may impose a force
 on two moving body segments (typically, bones), determining them to come
 closer to each other.
 This specificity of action is ensured by the presence of distinct, well-determi
ned insertion points, to which skeletal muscles are attached by the means
 of tendons and aponeuroses (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "mescher2013junqueiras"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tendons are dense connective tissue structure, which extend into the
 epimysium, a connective tissue sheath surrounding the muscle.
 In turn, epimysium emits connective septing structures termed perimysium,
 splitting muscles into subunits termed fascicles.
 At an even lower level, a thin, sparse connective structure called endomysium
 coats each polynucleate, elongated cell (termed myofiber).
 Connective tissue supports the terminal branches of the nervous, circulatory
 and lymphatic systems.
 In addition, connective tissue inside the muscle provides mechanical anchoring
 between fibers, longitudinally, laterally and with the tendons.
 This is particularly true of perimysium, whose collagen content is 95%
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "light1984characterization"

\end_inset

.
 The collagen in muscle-associated connective tissue is mainly of types
 I and III (reticulin), with traces of type V collagen and fibronectin,
 while the most frequent proteoglycan is collagen I-binding decorin
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "eggen1994decorin"

\end_inset

.
 The external lamina is the equivalent of basement membranes in other tissues,
 an proteic structure surrounding each multinucleate, roughly tubular cell.
 The external lamina contains collagen IV, laminin, and heparan sulfates
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "grounds2005strength,mann2011aberrant"

\end_inset

.
 Muscle mass changes should require remodeling of all these connective structure
s, with novel collagen synthesis possibly complicating protein synthesis
 at muscle level.
 In addition to the contractile and connective components, muscles include
 vascular, nervous, adipose, blood and immune cells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The myofiber is the histological base unit of contractile tissue.
 Another muscle-specific population of cells comprises the mononuclear,
 proliferating cells, called satellite cells.
 Satellite cells are nearly devoid of cytosol, sitting in close proximity
 to the fiber, under the external lamina.
 They can be identified by markers such as Pax7 and, on the membrane, CD34
 (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each myofiber is a syncytium, that forms and grows by fusion with neighboring
 cells.
 The only way to acquire nuclei to the myofibers is fusion with surrounding
 proliferative mononucleate cells.
 Cells that have the ability to undergo mitosis and to fuse with myofibers
 are typically designated myoblasts.
 In vivo, myoblasts are derived from a subset of satellite cells.
 Experimentally, Î±7 integrin is an effective marker for selecting proliferative
 precursors from muscle
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "blanco-bose2001purification"

\end_inset

, although its sensitivity and specificity are yet to be established.
 Alternate sources of nuclei in the myofiber are subject of ongoing research,
 but their relative importance is expected to be minor at best (reviewed
 in

 A transplant of seven satellite cells from an adult mouse is capable of
 yielding more than a hundred multinucleate myofibers, thus demonstrating
 former's ability to regenerate muscle
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The transformation of quiescent satellite cells to proliferating myoblast
 is regulated by the interplay of growth factors, external lamina, and contact
 with myofibers
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bischoff1986proliferation"

\end_inset

.
 In vivo, myofiber nuclei are typically peripheral, while in vitro incomplete
 models often yield elongated, contractile cells, with central nuclei, akin
 to regenerating fibers.
 The latter are typically termed myotubes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proliferative niche can play an important role in muscle atrophy and
 recovery.
 However, muscle hypertrophy may occur without cell divisions.
 For example, the muscles of mice receiving clenbuterol and of rats undergoing
 eccentric training gain 20-30% muscle mass without apparent DNA changes

 Quail muscles depleted of proliferating cells by irradiation still undergo
 hypertrophy in response to stretch-overload
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 These example of amitotic hypertrophy demonstrate that, in some circumstances,
 the number of nuclei and the pace of transcription are not limiting factors
 in muscle growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A large majority of the myofiber cytosol is the contractile apparatus, in
 the shape of bundles of protein filaments termed myofibrils.
 Within myofibrils, myosin and actin filaments alternate, held together
 by multiprotein complexes containing titin.
 Myofibril proteins are about two thirds of the total myofiber protein
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "waterlow1978protein"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, any myofiber size change with functional relevance should correlate
 with changes in myosin II and actin protein content.
 In rat muscles, three days of streptozotocin-induced acute diabetes causes
 intramuscular formation of a actin degradation fragment
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "du2004activation"

\end_inset

.
 The apparent sensitivity of actin to muscle mass regulators poses a technical
 challenge to protein and even mRNA measurements, because traditionally
 actin is considered a housekeeping, unregulated, and rather constant protein,
 and is used in level normalization.
 If, in an atrophying muscle, some protein of interest is depleted faster
 than actin, immunoblots will convey the certainty that the former is downregula
ted.
 But if the protein of interest is lost in a less preferential manner, at
 the same rate with actin, immunoblots normalized to actin will convey the
 mistaken appearance of constancy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar issues govern the use of 3MH as a marker for myofiber protein catabolism.
 Given that the main correlate of urinary 3MH is muscle mass
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lukaski1981relationship"

\end_inset

, 3MH measurement may lack sensitivity when used as a indicator for muscle
 catabolic rate.
 On one hand, increased catabolism is expected to cause increased 3MH output,
 but on the other, an atrophic muscle has less 3MH to release.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During experiments that perturb muscle mass equilibrium, the level of the
 regulators, of typical housekeeping proteins, and of non-myofiber proteins
 may fluctuate in manners that convolve their specific modulation with overall
 muscle protein kinetics.
 Investigation of recovery from muscle loss is burdened by the fact that
 it aims to dissect protein regulation, when the regulators are proteins
 themselves.

Around puberty, muscle growth is associated with a massive shift of nuclei
 from the satellite cells to the myofibers
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Even earlier, de novo muscle development is remarkable for its accretion
 of new nuclei to the myofiber.
 Pre-adulthood muscle growth appears reliant on hyperplasia, and cell proliferat
ion regulators are likely crucial in determination of muscle mass.

 further supporting the idea of duplicate function.
 Neither Myf5, nor MyoD induce muscle attributes.
 However, this specification stage is soon followed by expression of another
 MRF, myogenin, which synchronizes with expression of muscle-specific enzymes

 at other ages.
 Overall, muscle formation in children appears qualitatively different from
 adult muscle hypertrophy and regeneration, and should be more susceptible
 to modulation via mitotic mechanisms.
 This may be underlie a difference between juvenile and adult in the atrophying

 In contrast, after feeding, oversupply of NEFA is compensated mainly by
 increased uptake, in absolute terms, in the visceral adipose tissue, with
 minor contributions from other adipose tissue, liver, and muscle.

Muscle work is generated at such high rates, that most glucose use occurs
 in the cytosol, without shuttling to mitochondria, through glycolysis.
 Some of the tri-carbon byproduct of the muscle, pyruvate, is then further
 oxidized in the muscle in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, but a significant
 amount converted to lactate and released in the blood stream.
 As part of the Cori cycle, muscle-released lactate is reassembled into
 glucose by the liver, and re-released into the blood stream, for muscle
 use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A similar shuttling mechanism further enables muscle to rely on glycolysis,
 by transaminating excess pyruvate into the amino acid alanine.
 Alanine released in the blood is similarly converted by liver into glucose.
 Transamination requires the amino acid glutamate.
 In various tissues, glutamate can be converted interconverted with glutamine,
 or converted into various other non-essential amino acids, including glutamine,
 proline, or arginine.
 Indeed, at rest, human muscle uptakes significant amounts of glutamate,
 some serine, while releasing alanine, glutamine, and trace amounts of the
 other amino acids

 Among the amino acids with a trend for release, isoleucine, leucine, methionine

 Many studies trace leucine disappearance from the bloodstream, and have

With aging, muscle gradually shifts from a mitotic to a postmitotic profile,
 with muscle growth achieved increasingly through hypertrophy, that is,
 cell size growth.

However muscle also has a characteristic pattern of amino acid metabolism:
 the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine are rapidly
 degraded as are other nonessential amino acids, including alanine, glutamate
 and aspartate.
 However unlike other tissues, muscle does not degrade the carbon skeletons
 of several other amino acids such as phenylalanine and tyrosine.
 Leucine is an important energy source for muscle tissue particularly during
 fasting, and under these conditions leucine inhibits oxidation of glucose.
 In muscle the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids is accelerated after
 injury or during fasting, and yields amino groups, which are used for synthesis
 of alanine (from pyruvate) and glutamine (from glutamate).
 The de novo synthesis of alanine and glutamine is coupled to degradation
 of the branched-chain amino acids, and alanine and glutamine are normally
 exported from muscle in much larger amounts than predicted simply from
 their occurrence in muscle protein.
 Alanine is avidly taken up by the liver and used for gluconeogenesis, but

2010: The insulin-like growth factor-1 can block the transcriptional upregulatio
n of MuRF1 and MAFbx via the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt/Foxo pathway.
 MuRF1's substrates include several components of the sarcomeric thick filament,
 including myosin heavy chain.
 Thus, by blocking MuRF1, insulin-like growth factor-1 prevents the breakdown
 of the thick filament, particularly myosin heavy chain, which is asymmetrically
 lost in settings of cortisol-linked skeletal muscle atrophy.
 Insulin-like growth factor-1/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt signaling
 also dominantly inhibits the effects of myostatin, which is a member of
 the transforming growth factor-[beta] family of proteins.
 Deletion or inhibition of myostatin causes a significant increase in skeletal
 muscle size.
 Recently, myostatin has been shown to act both by inhibiting gene activation
 associated with differentiation, even when applied to postdifferentiated
 myotubes, and by blocking the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt pathway.

Ectopic overexpression of the eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3h and eIF3i subunits
 leads to transformation of cultured NIH-3T3 cells.
 This probably occurs through the stimulation of global protein synthesis,
 as well as increased translation efficiency of specific mRNAs that are
 normally poorly translated, including cyclin D1 (Ccnd1), Myc, ornithine
 decarboxylase 1 (Odc1) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2)

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The eIF4Eâ4E-BP complex might remain bound to the m7GpppN cap (as shown),
 possibly aiding the inhibition of cap-dependent mRNA translation owing
 to blockade of the mRNA 5â² end.
 Increased levels of hypophosphorylated 4E-BPs, in conjunction with elevated
 levels of eIF4G, can then function as a switch, as observed in certain
 locally advanced cancers, impairing the initiation of translation on purely
 cap-dependent mRNAs but enhancing translation of dual mechanism mRNAs that
 also contain an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to which eIF4G may
 bind directly.
 These mRNAs include vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), fibroblast
 growth factor 2 (FGF2), BCL2 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î± (HIF1A).
 This switch is activated by hypoxia and other stresses to preserve tumour
 cell viability and promote tumour angiogenesis.

Muscle protein synthesis decreased 26% after exercise and was associated
 with a fourfold increase in the amount of eIF4E present in the inactive
 eIF4E â 4E-BP1 complex and a concomitant 71% decrease in the association
 of eIF4E with eIF4G.
 Refeeding the complete meal, but not the carbohydrate meal, increased muscle
 protein synthesis equal to controls, despite similar plasma concentrations
 of insulin.
 Additionally, eIF4E â 4E-BP1 association was inversely related and eIF4E
 â eIF4G association was positively correlated to muscle protein synthesis.

IGF-I/IGFBP-3 ameliorates alterations in protein synthesis, eIF4E availability,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Alcohol decreased protein synthesis in WT mice, a change associated with
 less 4EBP1 phosphorylation, eIF4E-eIF4G binding, and raptor-4EBP1 binding,
 but greater mTOR-raptor complex formation.
 However, the content of eIF2Î± was not altered in muscle from alcohol-fed
 rats (Table 2).
 Furthermore, administration of IGF-I/IGFBP-3 did not alter the content
 eIF2Î± in either control or alcohol-fed rats.
 eIF-2Î± also undergoes reversible phosphorylation, and the extent of eIF2Î±
 phosphorylation is inversely proportional to changes in protein synthesis
 (33).
 However, there was also no change in the phosphorylation status of eIF2Î±
 in response to either alcohol feeding or the binary complex.
 These data suggest that effects of the binary complex on protein synthesis
 are independent of changes in eIF2Î± protein and phosphorylation state.

Women have less muscle than men but lose it more slowly during aging.
 To discover potential underlying mechanism(s) for this we evaluated the
 muscle protein synthesis process in postabsorptive conditions and during
 feeding in twenty-nine 65â80 year old men (n = 13) and women (n = 16).
 We discovered that the basal concentration of phosphorylated eEF2Thr56
 was ~40% less (P<0.05) and the basal rate of MPS was ~30% greater (P = 0.02)
 in women than in men; the basal concentrations of muscle phosphorylated
 AktThr308, p70s6kThr389, eIF4ESer209, and eIF4E-BP1Thr37/46 were not different
 between the sexes.
 Feeding increased (P<0.05) AktThr308 and p70s6kThr389 phosphorylation to
 the same extent in men and women but increased (P<0.05) the phosphorylation
 of eIF4ESer209 and eIF4E-BP1Thr37/46 in men only.
 Accordingly, feeding increased MPS in men (P<0.01) but not in women.

The atrophic effect of testosterone (T) deprivation and the opposite, rescuing,
 effect of T administration on muscle mass are induced by a multitude of
 cellular mediators, in accordance with Tâs pleiotropic nature.
 Earlier findings show that at least part of its effect is at the level
 of protein translation1.
 We hypothesize that T regulates protein translation, in both non-specific
 (cap-dependent initiation, elongation factors, ribosomal recycling) and
 specific manners (internal ribosome entry site).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The effects of T are typically observed only at organism level, at which
 a distinction between these concurrent regulatory pathways is difficult
 to make.
 In order to determine changes in the non-specific regulation of translation,
 we will determine changes of pattern in the proteins that associate with
 polysomes in vivo, as an effect of testosterone deprivation and/or testosterone
 treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A required initial step is the isolation of translating mRNAs (polysomes)
 and of ribosome-free mRNAs.
 We will obtain specimens of levator ani, a slow-twitching muscle, from
 male mice that underwent castration, with or without T treatment.
 The castration effects will be observed at 14 days after surgery or sham
 intervention, while testosteroneâs effect will be observed after 7 days
 of treatment.
 The muscle polysomes will be isolated from levator ani, obtained by necropsy
 from 3 animals for each experimental condition.
 The resulting sample size is comparable to that used in similar earlier
 experiments, 50 mg2.
 Cells will be lysed in the presence of 0.1 g/L cycloheximide (blocks peptide
 elongation, locking the translating ribosomes in place), 1 g/L heparin
 or other RNAse inhibitor (Protector), 0.5 mM DTT (maintains cytosol-like
 reductive environment), 5 mM Mg2+ (stabilizes mRNA structures), in addition
 to regular lysis buffer, and lysed by the standard procedure (incubation
 with Triton).
 The lysate will be precleared by gentle centrifugation, as 12000g, recommended
 by Arava3, might lead to microsomal loss, favoring mRNA for soluble proteins.
 The sucrose gradient will be obtained as described3, comprising the interval
 10-50% sucrose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For further analysis, we will pool the fractions as follows: the first fractions
, lighter than 40S subunits, will constitute the ribosome-free mRNAs pool;
 the latter group of peaks, after 80S, will include translated mRNAs pool.
 The distinction between monoribosomal mRNAâs and polyribosomal mRNAâs is
 of reduced theoretical importance, and will be technically challenging,
 according to Arava3.
 Also, the 43S sub-peak, consisting of mRNAâs that are stalled at initiation,
 will be difficult to purify, and relatively difficult to use in a comparison,
 because the counterpart, the translating mRNA pool, will also contain similarly
 stalled ribosomes.
 A comparison between 43S (or 48S) initiating complexes and translating
 ribosomes would be possible by using larger specimens, by using a less
 steep gradient, e.g.
 10-30%, or by using an apparatus similar to that presented by Esposito
 et al.4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At this time, we should be able to confirm earlier observations, by determining
 differences in the ratio translated-to-untranslated mRNA, which can be
 quantified by qPCR in the two pools with olygo-T primers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To determine non-specific regulatory mechanisms acting on protein translation
 as an effect of T treatment, we will compare the proteins in the translating
 mRNAâs fraction between treatments.
 We will approach the problem in two ways, without and with a priori knowledge.
 In the former approach, we will perform mass spectroscopy studies on the
 proteins of the translating ribosome pool, in which case we expect to find
 quantitative and/or qualitative (PTM) differences in the presence and absence
 of T.
 In the latter approach, we will quantify by immunoblot and densitometry
 the following proteins:

To determine effect of T on translation of specific mRNAs, the same two
 approaches can be taken.
 The approach without a priori knowledge will consist in the microarray
 analysis comparing translating-to-untranslated ratios of mRNA between presence
 and absence of T.
 The informed approach will involve the same type of comparisons by qPCR
 or densitometric Northern blot for the mRNAs that were found to be regulated
 by T in the microarray and/or any protein which is known to be regulated
 by T (e.g., atrogin).

* Calculate number of ribosomes per fraction through the A254 curve, counting
 the peaks.
 For the fractions where resolution is not good (many ribosomes per messenger),
 a logarithmic extrapolation can be used (see Arava, 2002).
 The extrapolation may be confirmed by cleavage of specific genes followed
 by northern for the ribosomes on that region (unclear, but mentioned by
 Arava, 2002).
 Use qPCR for the messenger of interest to determine the amount of messenger
 per fraction.
 Arava suggests using the peak fraction as indicative of number of ribosomes
 per messenger, while Lacsina (2011) uses the qPCR results from each fraction
 and calculates an weighted average of ribosomes per specific messenger.
 From these two numbers, one get number of ribosomes per mRNA molecule.
 Using ORF size, one can calculate average distance between ribosomes on
 specific mRNAs.
