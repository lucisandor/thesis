This report describes data from 2012.08.23 experiment (7 days of D and / or T).

```{r, echo=TRUE}
source('../thesis.R')
pandoc.table(aggregate(mydata[,i], list(mydata$V2), mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
