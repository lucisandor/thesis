Cushing's syndrome
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through the detailed case series written by Harvey Cushing
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "cushing1912pituitary"

\end_inset

, the scientific and medical community became aware of an otherwise rare
 disease, which bears his name.
 Unlike the earlier and better-studied deficiencies of the thyroid and pancreas,
 pituitary defects were more variable in manifestation and therefore harder
 to unify in a single clinical entity.
 Even when macroscopic hypertrophy of pituitary were localized to a gland
 subdomain, it was unclear whether observed pathology could be attributed
 to a hypersecretion from the hypertrophied sector, or to a deficiency in
 the neighboring compressed structures.
 Similarly, pituitary extracts caused multiple, and even opposite effects,
 in animal models
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "schafer1899physiological"

\end_inset

, suggestive of a mixture of hormones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among 50 cases described by Cushing, about five stood out due to the involvement
 of other glands.
 In each of them, and, to a lesser extent, in a few more cases, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hyperadrenalism
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was blamed for asthenia, hyperpigmentation of skin, low blood pressure,
 and hypoglycemia.
 Histopathology tests localized the adrenal abnormalities to the zona fasciculat
a of the cortex.
 Cushing wrote that some of these abnormalities, reflect current adrenal
 hypoactivity, caused by exhaustion after preceding intense stimulation
 and hyperactivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Twenty years later, Cushing narrowed the focus in an updated case series
 of combined pituitary-adrenal pathology
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cushing1932basophil"

\end_inset

.
 Cushing noted that basophile adenomata of the pituitary and hypertrophy
 of the adrenal glands often coexisted.
 Based on the curative effect of pituitary surgery, he hypothesized that
 the adrenal defect is secondary to the pituitary abnormality.
 In turn, he inferred that the adrenal changes mediate the disease phenotype,
 which includes obesity with ectopic adipose deposits, kyphosis, amenorrhoea
 / impotence, hypertrichosis, lineae atrophicae, fatigability and weakness.
 Among these disease manifestations, muscle impairment was a serious, if
 variable, component.
 Cushing considered intense muscle loss the cause of death for one of these
 cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cushing's work did little to elucidate mechanisms leading to the phenotype.
 The variability in pituitary changes between the cases he described meant
 that many scientists rejected his hypothesis of pituitary primacy.
 A group at the Mayo Clinic was actively pursuing the opposite hypothesis,
 with the adrenal as the primary site of impairment in adrenal-pituitary
 combined afflictions
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kepler1949cushings"

\end_inset

.
 On the clinical side, it was noted that some of Cushing's patients lacked
 observable pituitary changes.
 Moreover, some of the Mayo patients were cured by adrenal surgery.
 From a theoretical perspective, the adrenal hypothesis was more tempting
 because the adrenal deficiency (termed Addison's disease) and its reversal
 by administration of adrenal cortex extracts were better known than pituitary
 pathology

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today, we know that the truth was more nuanced.
 Oversecretion of the adrenal cortex hormones cortisol and / or corticosterone
 is termed hypercortisolism.
 One or more clinical signs listed by Cushing (see above) suggest to the
 practitioner the activation of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "HPA"
description "hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal"

\end_inset

) axis.
 If concomitant hypercortisolism is confirmed by an increase of urine free
 cortisol measurements, or by the effacement of the evening trough in circulatin
g cortisol, there is suspicion for Cushing's syndrome (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "CS"
description "Cushing's syndrome"

\end_inset

)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "nieman2008diagnosis"

\end_inset

.
 Some hypercortisolism cases, termed pseudo-Cushing's syndrome, are ascribed
 to causes outside the HPA axis, such as in depression, morbid obesity,
 uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and sleep apnea (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "nieman2002diagnostic"

\end_inset

).
\begin_inset Note Greyedout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In theory, pseudo-Cushing responds to suppression tests by low dose Dexa,
 while true CS does not.
 In practice, specificity is very low and sensitivity is 95%, so latest
 guidelines are recommending against suppression tests.
 Tumors may be less responsive in Dexa suppression and in ACTH stimulation
 tests than hyperplasias per PMID: 4342889
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
True CS cases are further classified based on the role of the adrenal-stimulatin
g pituitary hormone corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone; 
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "ACTH"
description "adrenocorticotropic hormone;"

\end_inset

).
 In some CS patients, hypercortisolism is paralleled by an increase in ACTH.
 Their adrenals are usually responsive to further ACTH stimulation tests,
 indicating that previously intact adrenals underwent hyperplasia in response
 to a pathological overstimulation with ACTH.
 When attributed to the pituitary, such ACTH oversecretion, followed by
 secondary hypercortisolism, is termed Cushing's disease (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kirk2000cushings"

\end_inset

).
 Cushing's disease remains a staple of physiology textbooks, because it
 provides an excellent didactic example of a hormone hierarchy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of CS cases consists of hypercortisolism in spite of low ACTH.
 In primary hypercortisolism, ACTH is typically suppressed by negative feedback.
 Adrenal neoplasms are are the most frequent cause of primary hypercortisolism.
 Ectopic or diffuse unregulated sources of ACTH or cortisol may cause hypercorti
solism.
 In recent decades, overdose with synthetic derivatives of cortisol became
 the most important cause of low-intensity CS (discussed in the next section).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite being caused by a diverse set of HPA pathologies, CS is quite invaiable
 in its ability to cause muscle impairment.

A series of serendipitous decisions brought impressive knowledge about CS
 of non-pituitary etiology (reviewed in
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 First, during World War II, US intelligence learned that Germans were importing
 large quantities of adrenal glands from neutral Argentina.
 This reignited US government interest in corticoadrenal research, despite
 the lackluster results with earlier adrenal extracts.
 At the end of the war, only a few grams of pure adrenal steroids were manufactu
red, from endogenous sources and at a high cost.
 The second opportunity was in the allocation of those scarce steroids.
 One of them, cortisone, made by Merck, was shared by a few clinical researchers
, including Phillip Hench.
 Hench's request was based on his previous work on rheumatoid arthritis.
 He observed that rheumatoid arthritis was alleviated in jaundice, and hypothesi
zed the existence of a steroidal

.
 Third, Hench's choice of dose and route elicited an extraordinary reversal
 in arthritic pain and dysfunction.
 In 1949, after treating only five patients
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, impressive improvements in those cases triggered redirected corticosteroid
 research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous work did describe multiple effects for adrenal extracts, but little
 was known about purer preparations, such as cortisone.
 In fact, adrenal research was discouraged prior to cortisone purification,
 because less pure extracts combined antagonistic hormones in variable doses,
 leading to the impression that they lack a defined pharmacological effect.
 However, even with purified cortisone, Hench saw a very diverse set of
 consequences for cortisone administration

First, cortisone's action on metabolism was accessible even to the less
 sophisticated clinical measurements used 60 years ago.
 Patients receiving cortisone gained weight.
 Chronic cortisone therapy led to accumulation of adipose tissue, often
 in ectopic locations, such as the interscapular

 Cortisone also induced hyperglycemia which can induce glycosuria.
 For this reason, cortisone, and its endogenous and synthetic analogs, are
 grouped in the glucocorticoid (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

description "glucocorticoid"

\end_inset

) family.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hench and collaborators hypothesized that cortisone's protective action
 is not limited to rheumatoid arthritis.
 In his 1950 Nobel lecture, Hench envisaged a role for alleviation of most
 inflammatory diseases.
 GCs share the ability to reduce inflammation (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "clark2007anti-inflammatory,coutinho2011anti-inflammatory"

\end_inset

).
 Some of these anti-inflammatory effects, such as reduction in the number
 of circulating white blood cells, are ample and robust.
 The cellular and molecular anti-inflammatory mechanisms are still subject
 of active research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The knowledge gap around the anti-inflammatory actions of GCs is in part
 caused by the immunology progress.
 Still, some questions remain open, and illustrate the convoluted ways in
 which GC signals are relayed in the cell.
 For example, GCs are often acting in a manner shared with all steroids,
 by binding and activating the glucocorticoid receptor (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "GR"
description "glucocorticoid receptor"

\end_inset

).
 Activated GR translocates from cytosol to the nucleus, where it dimerizes
 on specific DNA sequences, termed glucocorticoid responsive-elements (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

symbol "GRE"
description "glucocorticoid responsive-elements"

\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "truss1990contacts"

\end_inset

.
 The classical effect of the GRE-GR interaction is increased transcription
 for neighboring target genes (transactivation), as it is the case in polymorpho
nucleate cells with interleukin 1 (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "IL-1"

\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "re1994type"

\end_inset

, a decoy inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory IL-1.
 In other circumstances, the activated receptor inhibits transcription directly
 (transrepression), or by interfering with transcription factors.
 For example, in human T lymphocytes, GCs inhibit the transcription factor
 activator protein 1 (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "AP-1"
description "activator protein 1"

\end_inset

), thus causing a reduction in their ability to synthesize pro-inflammatory
 interleukin 2 (

 GCs employ nongenomic mechanisms, such as mRNA stability and enzymatic
 activity modulations.

 8 (IL-8), the major chemoattractant for neutrophils

 Within minutes, GC administration induces vasodilation, through direct,
 non-genomic activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (

Some GC effects may be limited to a range of doses, durations, and frequencies
 of administration.
 Moreover, the example of adrenalectomized rats re-supplemented with corticoster
one, their most abundant endogenous GC, illustrates how, at times, the same
 GC can induce or repress the same cellular response, depending on the dose.
 A 5 mg / kg physiological dose enhances the immune skin delayed-type hypersensi
tivity, while a pharmacological 40 mg / kg dose yields the more typical
 GC immunosuppressive behavior

 This behavior, suggestive of a U (or inverted U) shaped response curve,
 is called hormesis or biphasic response, and poses great challenges, both
 to the investigative scientist and to the clinician attempting to establish
 a therapeutic regimen.

 These findings suggest that anti-inflammatory and hyperglycemic actions
 are intermediated by the same specific, Dexa-sensitive receptor, whereas
 electrolyte changes are caused by cortisol through a different pathway.

 have failed.

 A similar, paradoxical situation is seen in ongoing clinical research.
 As of 2015, the patent-free status of the GCs discourages trials for new
 indications, while their de facto standard-of-care status makes them a
 common comparator in clinical trials.
 The National Cancer Institute sponsors 311 ongoing clinical studies employing
 Dexa, mainly in the standard-of-care arm, thus providing a plethora of
 data which have been, and may still be, misconstrued as support for the
 use of GCs.
 Every day practice may drift further apart for the officially sanctioned
 label, thus providing new opportunities for unjustifiable overdose.

 Taking into account the large variability between trials and the use of

 Clinical studies directly addressing this comparison in patients prescribed
 high-dose GC are recommended, given that the most commonly accepted hypothesis
 centers on the proteasome as main effector of GC-induced muscle loss.
 It is still more likely to find that bortezomib provides muscle protection.
 Proving a beneficial action of bortezomib in co-administration with GC

 In both hyercortisolism and hypocortisolism, effects on human muscle remain
 understudied.
 Human studies concord that GC-induced loss of muscle force is an objective
 finding caused by an increased proteolytic activity.
 Indirect evidence indicate human GAML is associated with changes in protein
 synthesis.
 In the absence of other proven mitigating interventions, current guidelines
 suggest GC discontinuation if myopathy develops.
 Animal models have been essential for the study of GC-induced muscle loss,

 The same circumstances meant that utility of AAS therapy in steroid myopathy

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Male hormones have been considered an efficacious anabolic therapy long
 before they were purified and tested.
 The effects of male castration, such as reductions in aggressiveness and
 muscle force, were discovered independently by many human civilizations,
 starting more than three thousand years ago.
 Castration is omnipresent in ancient mythology, and, more mundanely, in
 primitive farming.
 For almost as long, people perceived testis ingestion as a reversal of
 castration, thought to improve muscle force.
 Such perceptions were caused by the placebo effect alone, given that this
 testis active principle is almost completely degraded by liver.

Testis extract benefits received more attention starting around 1889, when
 Brown-Séquard published his theory about rejuvenating abilities of sperm.
 He thought that loss of sperm during aging or masturbation causes degradation
 in muscle and brain performance, and hypothesized that chemicals from sperm
 may pass into blood where they have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

a most-essential use in giving strength to the nervous system and to other
 parts.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Consequently, he injected himself with a combination of sperm and testis
 extracts, which led to self-reported improvements in physical and intellectual
 abilities
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 He describes how, at the age of 72, a single injection enables him stand
 for hours, or write longer scientific papers.
 Later on, he describes how testis extracts appeared to alleviate

 Because the active principle in testis is made as needed, rather than stored

The cultural context in which Brown-Séquard worked introduced multiple biases
 in his experiments and conclusions.
 His mistaken theses were constrained into rather low-quality experiments,
 which luckily provided useful, testable, and eventually proven scientific
 hypotheses.
 First, the logical conclusion for Brown-Séquard's theory would have been
 endorsement for semen therapy.
 Instead, due to the semen taboo, Brown-Séquard and his disciples resorted
 to surrogate interventions, such as vasectomy, believed to preserve sperm
 in the body, and injections with testis extracts.
 The introduction of injections gave a new lease of life to the therapeutic
 use of organ extracts, called

, which had been banished from the British Pharmacopoeia in 1788 after failing
 the test of oral administration.
 Some organotherapies were shams or even harmful.
 Yet a few of them provided evidence that specific parts of the body store
 or release into the blood stream chemicals, which subsequently induce changes
 in other specific parts of the body.
 This conjecture led the discovery of endocrine glands and the establishment
 of endocrinology as a science.
 In fact, androgen organotherapy provided the pattern to GC discovery.

 Georgian pastimes, such as cock fighting, horse racing, or cricket, are

 selling out Royal Albert Hall in 1901.
 Brown-Séquard's promise of muscle without effort makes testis organotherapy
 a widespread, well-earning business.

During the 1950's, AAS became part of the standard of care for endogenous
 hypercortisolism during the gap between diagnosis and curative surgery.
 However, this gap narrowed to a few weeks, due to improvements in differential
 diagnosis.
 Development of accurate cortisol assays allowed the measurement of its
 changes in response to Dexa, thus discriminating conditions where feedback
 mechanisms fail (mainly endocrine neoplasms) from cortisol-stimulating
 non-endocrine conditions.
 ACTH assays differentiate ACTH-independent cases (typically adrenal tumors)
 from the ACTH-dependent ones (usually localized in the pituitary).
 Modern imaging, including computed tomography of the adrenal and magnetic
 resonance imaging of the pituitary, identify the target of surgery.
 AAS therapy is now confined to inoperable cases, including unidentified
 ectopic sources of ACTH or cortisone.
 Even these cases benefit from more targeted interventions (see

 However, their study differs in key aspects from the other studies and
 the medical practice.
 They tested a variable, moderate dose of T on normogonadal older men, with
 the goal of maintaining a physiological T level.
 Moderate T therapy caused an improvement in muscle mass, strength, and
 net protein balance.
 However, they failed to observe an improvement in protein FSR, and concluded
 that the net protein balance improvement must be caused by T-induced inhibition
 of protein degradation.
 The failure to detect protein synthesis rate changes indicates that, perhaps
 due to unusual treatments, this study yielded unusual outcomes, which cannot
