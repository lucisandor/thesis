# Nick Sandor's PhD dissertation
This repository contains the pre-processed data and the statistical routines used in my PhD dissertation. (The name "thesis" was used as an abbreviation.) The raw data, including high quality immunoblot images, are available upon request, but were not included, as they are quite large. Prior to the publication, this repository was used for backup purposes.
