Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Glucocorticoids (GC) are used widely for the treatment of a large number
 of inflammatory conditions.
 Loss of muscle mass and muscle weakness are common complications of GC
 therapy.
 Androgen therapy has been suggested to reverse GC-associated muscle loss
 (GAML), but evidence of its effectiveness is lacking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, I established a mouse model of GAML.
 Young adult male mice receiving 0.25 mg/day dexamethasone (D) s.c.
 daily, for a week, lost 3% of their body weight.
 Through NMR lean body mass quantification and muscle dissection, a loss
 of more than 10% of their muscle mass was lost.
 More than half of the muscle loss was reversed by co-administration of
 0.7 mg/day testosterone (T).
 This is the first mouse model of GAML alleviation by T.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intramuscular atrogene expression and proteasome catalytic activity were
 upregulated by D and suppressed by T co-administration.
 T co-administration caused intramuscular downregulation of atrogene-activating
 Foxo transcription factors.
 Intramuscular pro-autophagic REDD1 and Klf15 were repressed by T co-administrat
ion.
 T co-administration reduced the autophagosome-characteristic lipidated
 form of LC3B.
 Translation regulators 4E-BP, eIF3f, and eIF2 did not change significantly
 as a result of androgen co-administration.
 Calpains activity and levels were unchanged by D and T.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
C2C12 differentiated myotubes were used to determine the effects of T and
 D on protein synthesis and degradation.
 Myotube diameters were reduced by D, while T co-administration suppressed
 D effect.
 Protein degradation was increased by 24-hour D treatment.
 D-stimulated protein degradation was inhibited by proteasome inhibitor
 MG132, and, to a lesser degree, by lysosome inhibitor chloroquine.
 T co-administration returned protein degradation to basal levels.
 Protein synthesis response to D and T did not correlate with the observed
 phenotypes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In vivo, D reduced intramuscular IGF-I expression, an effect reversed by
 T co-administration.
 In C2C12, inhibition of IGF-1R signaling with picropodophyllin did not
 modify T effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, T protective action in GAML is mainly anti-catabolic, through
 reversal of proteasome and autophagosome upregulation induced by D.
 T stimulates a potentially protective intramuscular IGF-I response.
 Different models are needed to determine the role of protein synthesis
 and of IGF-I in GAML.

Cushing's syndrome
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through the detailed case series written by Harvey Cushing
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "cushing1912pituitary"

\end_inset

, the scientific and medical community became aware of an otherwise rare
 disease, which bears his name.
 Unlike the earlier and better-studied deficiencies of the thyroid and pancreas,
 pituitary defects were more variable in manifestation and therefore harder
 to unify in a single clinical entity.
 Even when macroscopic hypertrophy of pituitary was localized to a gland
 subdomain, pathological mechanisms were ambiguous.
 Symptoms could have been attributed to a hypersecretion from the hypertrophied
 sector, or to a deficiency in the neighboring compressed structures.
 Pituitary extracts caused multiple, and even opposite effects, in animal
 models
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "schafer1899physiological"

\end_inset

, further proving the heterogeneous nature of pituitary secretion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among 50 cases described by Cushing, about five stood out due to the involvement
 of other glands.
 In each of them, and, to a lesser extent, in a few more cases, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hyperadrenalism
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was blamed for asthenia, hyperpigmentation of skin, low blood pressure,
 and hypoglycemia.
 Histopathology tests localized the adrenal abnormalities to the zona fasciculat
a of the cortex.
 Cushing wrote that some of these abnormalities reflect current adrenal
 hypoactivity, caused by exhaustion after preceding intense stimulation
 and hyperactivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Twenty years later, Cushing narrowed the focus in an updated case series
 of combined pituitary-adrenal pathology
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cushing1932basophil"

\end_inset

.
 Cushing noted that basophile adenomata of the pituitary and hypertrophy
 of the adrenal glands often coexisted.
 Based on the curative effect of pituitary surgery, he hypothesized that
 the adrenal defect is secondary to the pituitary abnormality.
 In turn, he inferred that the adrenal changes mediate the disease phenotype,
 which includes obesity with ectopic adipose deposits, kyphosis, amenorrhea
 / impotence, hypertrichosis, lineae atrophicae, fatigability and weakness.
 Among these disease manifestations, muscle impairment was a serious, if
 variable, component.
 Cushing considered intense muscle loss the cause of death for one of these
 cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cushing's work did little to elucidate mechanisms leading to the phenotype.
 The variability in pituitary changes between the cases he described meant
 that many scientists rejected his hypothesis of pituitary primacy.
 A group at the Mayo Clinic was actively pursuing the opposite hypothesis,
 with the adrenal as the primary site of impairment in adrenal-pituitary
 combined afflictions
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kepler1949cushings"

\end_inset

.
 On the clinical side, it was noted that some of Cushing's patients lacked
 observable pituitary changes.
 Moreover, some of the Mayo patients were cured by adrenal surgery.
 From a theoretical perspective, the adrenal hypothesis was more tempting
 because the adrenal deficiency (termed Addison's disease) and its reversal
 by administration of adrenal cortex extracts were better known than pituitary
 pathology
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "thorn1939treatment"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today, we know that the truth was more nuanced.
 Hypersecretion of the adrenal cortex hormones cortisol and / or corticosterone
 is termed hypercortisolism.
 One or more clinical signs listed by Cushing (see above) suggest to the
 practitioner the activation of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "HPA"
description "hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal"

\end_inset

) axis.
 If concomitant hypercortisolism is confirmed by an increase of urine free
 cortisol measurements, or by the effacement of the evening trough in circulatin
g cortisol, there is suspicion for Cushing's syndrome (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "CS"
description "Cushing's syndrome"

\end_inset

)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "nieman2008diagnosis"

\end_inset

.
 Some hypercortisolism cases, termed pseudo-Cushing's syndrome, are ascribed
 to causes outside the HPA axis, such as in depression, morbid obesity,
 uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and sleep apnea (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "nieman2002diagnostic"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
True CS cases are further classified based on the role of the adrenal-stimulatin
g pituitary hormone corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone; 
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "ACTH"
description "adrenocorticotropic hormone;"

\end_inset

).
 In some CS patients, hypercortisolism is paralleled by an increase in ACTH.
 Their adrenals are usually responsive to further ACTH stimulation tests,
 indicating that previously intact adrenals underwent hyperplasia in response
 to a pathological overstimulation with ACTH.
 When attributed to the pituitary, such ACTH hypersecretion, followed by
 secondary hypercortisolism, is termed Cushing's disease (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kirk2000cushings"

\end_inset

).
 Cushing's disease remains a staple of physiology textbooks, because it
 provides an excellent didactic example of a hormone hierarchy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of CS cases consists of hypercortisolism despite low ACTH.
 In primary hypercortisolism, ACTH is typically suppressed by negative feedback.
 Adrenal neoplasms are the most frequent cause of primary hypercortisolism.
 Ectopic or diffuse unregulated sources of ACTH or cortisol may cause hypercorti
solism.
 In recent decades, overdose with synthetic derivatives of cortisol became
 the most important cause of low-intensity CS (discussed in the next section).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although CS may originate in various HPA pathologies, muscle impairment
 is one of its most common, unifying features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Glucocorticoid therapy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A series of serendipitous decisions brought impressive knowledge about CS
 of non-pituitary etiology (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "glyn1998discovery"

\end_inset

).
 First, during World War II, US intelligence learned that Germans were importing
 large quantities of adrenal glands from neutral Argentina.
 This reignited US government interest in corticoadrenal research, despite
 the lackluster results with earlier adrenal extracts.
 At the end of the war, only a few grams of pure adrenal steroids were manufactu
red, from endogenous sources and at a high cost.
 The second opportunity was in the allocation of those scarce steroids.
 One of them, cortisone, made by Merck, was shared by a few clinical researchers
, including Phillip Hench.
 Hench's request was based on his previous work on rheumatoid arthritis.
 He observed that rheumatoid arthritis was alleviated in jaundice, and hypothesi
zed the existence of a steroidal 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

anti-rheumatoid factor.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Third, Hench's choice of dose and route elicited an extraordinary reversal
 in arthritic pain and dysfunction.
 In 1949, after treating only five patients
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hench1964reversibility"

\end_inset

, impressive improvements in those cases reordered priorities in corticosteroid
 research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous work did describe multiple effects for adrenal extracts.
 In fact, adrenal research was considered a dead end prior to cortisone
 purification, because less pure extracts combined antagonistic hormones
 in variable doses, seemingly lacking defined pharmacological or endocrine
 relevance.
 Even with purified cortisone, Hench saw a very diverse set of consequences
 for cortisone administration
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "sprague1950observations"

\end_inset

.
 However, these effects were invariant, demonstrating the complex and vital
 role of the adrenal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, cortisone's action on metabolism was accessible even to the less
 sophisticated clinical measurements used 60 years ago.
 Patients receiving cortisone gained weight.
 Chronic cortisone therapy led to accumulation of adipose tissue, often
 in ectopic locations, such as the interscapular 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

Hench and collaborators hypothesized that cortisone's protective action
 is not limited to rheumatoid arthritis.
 In his 1950 Nobel lecture, Hench envisaged a role for alleviation of most
 inflammatory diseases.
 GCs share the ability to reduce inflammation (reviewed in

).
 Some of these anti-inflammatory effects, such as reduction in the number
 of circulating white blood cells, are ample and robust.
 Other aspects of GC action remain under active study, facilitated by the
 rapid progress of immunology.
 The questions still open illustrate the convoluted ways in which GC signals
 are relayed in the cell.
 For example, GCs are often acting in a manner shared with all steroid hormones,
 by binding and activating the glucocorticoid receptor (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

).
 Activated GR translocates from cytosol to the nucleus, where it dimerizes
 on specific DNA sequences, termed glucocorticoid responsive-elements (

 The classical effect of the GRE-GR interaction is increased transcription

 For example, in human T lymphocytes, GCs inhibit the transcription factor
 activator protein 1 (

 Two distinct proteolytic systems, the proteasome - ubiquitin system and

 Unfortunately, only one published trial investigated the action of GC in
 human muscle biopsies, at a molecular level.
 It failed to find a significant change in mRNA of ubiquitin and the C3

 The result is unsurprising, given that the control of the proteasome system

 Neither finding is suggestive for superiority of that the combination (Dexa

 Clinical studies directly addressing this comparison are recommended, given
 that the most commonly accepted hypothesis centers on the proteasome as
 main effector of GC-induced muscle loss.
 Proving a beneficial action of bortezomib in co-administration with GC

 Even proving the opposite, that bortezomib has no protective action, will
 be very valuable in better understanding and eventually preventing GC-induced

 First, the logical conclusion for Brown-Séquard's theory would have been
 endorsement for semen therapy.
 Instead, due to the semen taboo, Brown-Séquard and his disciples resorted
 to surrogate interventions, such as vasectomy, believed to preserve sperm
 in the body, and injections with testis extracts.
 The introduction of injections gave a new lease of life to the therapeutic
 use of organ extracts, called

 Some organotherapies were shams or even harmful.
 Yet a few of them provided evidence that specific parts of the body store
 or release into the blood stream chemicals, which subsequently induce changes
 in other specific parts of the body.
 This conjecture led the discovery of endocrine glands and the establishment
 of endocrinology as a science.
 In fact, androgen organotherapy provided the pattern to GC discovery.

The second dark age of Testo was a time of poor knowledge and poor clinical
 study design.
 Yet in these years, androgenic steroids first gained their reputation as
 ergogenics.
 Kenyon noted in his studies on eunuchoid men that Testo injections helped
 them gain weight through protein accretion, as demonstrated by a reduction
 in urinary nitrogen.
 Other trials evidenced benefits from androgenic therapy in muscle-depleting
 conditions, including thyrotoxic myopathy

During the 1950's, AAS became part of the standard of care for endogenous
 hypercortisolism during the gap between diagnosis and curative surgery.
 However, this gap narrowed to a few weeks, due to improvements in differential
 diagnosis.
 Development of accurate cortisol assays allowed the measurement of its
 changes in response to Dexa, thus discriminating conditions where feedback
 mechanisms fail (mainly endocrine neoplasms) from cortisol-stimulating
 non-endocrine conditions.
 ACTH assays differentiate ACTH-independent cases (typically adrenal tumors)
 from the ACTH-dependent ones (usually localized in the pituitary).
 Modern imaging, including computed tomography of the adrenal and magnetic
 resonance imaging of the pituitary, identify the target of surgery.
 AAS therapy is now confined to inoperable cases, including unidentified
 ectopic sources of ACTH or cortisone.
 Even these cases benefit from more targeted interventions (see

 They tested a variable, moderate dose of Testo on normogonadal older men,
 with the goal of maintaining a physiological Testo level over six months.
 This moderate Testo therapy caused an improvement in muscle mass, strength,
 and net protein balance, in the absence of an improvement in protein FSR.
 Therefore, muscle protein accretion could be attributed to decreased protein
 degradation.
 Moreover, Ferrando and colleagues showed a significant decrease in the
 proteasomal enzymatic activity following Testo therapy.

For the most part, the skeletal muscles confers the three-dimensional intricate
 conformation of the body, suggesting a complex, detailed organization,
 at least at macroscopic level.
 In contrast, at cell level, the relatively high specialization of the skeletal
 muscle leaves little space for diversity or inhomogeneity.
 Muscles' diverse shapes are conferred by non-contractile auxiliary structures.
 Largest of these structures, tendons and aponeuroses attach the muscle
 to other body structures (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mescher2013junqueiras"

\end_inset

).
 The tendons are dense connective tissue structure, which extend into the
 epimysium, a connective tissue sheath surrounding the muscle.
 In turn, epimysium emits connective septing structures termed perimysium,
 splitting muscles into subunits termed fascicles.
 At an even lower level, a thin, sparse connective structure called endomysium
 coats each polynucleate, elongated cell (termed myofiber).
 The connective tissue inside the muscle provides mechanical anchoring between
 fibers, longitudinally, laterally and with the tendons.
 This is particularly true of perimysium, which is almost acellular, at
 95% collagen content
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "light1984characterization"

\end_inset

.
 Intramuscular connective structures carry terminal branches of the nervous,
 circulatory and lymphatic systems.
 In addition, muscles include adipose and immune cells.
 Muscle mass changes requires remodeling of all these connective structures
 and may confound in vivo studies.
 For example, collagen synthesis or macrophage proliferation may misleadingly
 increase during slow muscle atrophy.

The elongated, multinucleate myofiber is the histological base unit of contracti

 A large majority of the myofiber cytosol is the contractile apparatus,
 in the shape of bundles of protein filaments termed myofibrils.
 Within myofibrils, myosin and actin filaments alternate, held together
 by multi-protein complexes containing titin.
 Myofibril proteins are about two thirds of the total myofiber protein
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "waterlow1978protein"

 Therefore, any myofiber size change with functional relevance should correlate
 with changes in myosin II and actin protein content.
 The sizable actin content poses a challenge to muscle studies.
 Traditionally, in biological studies, actin is considered a housekeeping,
 unregulated, invariable protein, and is used in level normalization.
 In muscle, especially in atrophy, actin cannot be invariable.
 or example, in rat muscles atrophying due to streptozotocin-induced acute
 diabetes, an actin degradation fragment is detectable

 Therefore, in atrophy studies, normalization to actin may misleadingly
 reduce the apparent rate of depletion for other proteins.
 Similar issues govern the use of 3MH as a marker for myofibril protein
 catabolism.
 Given that the main correlate of urinary 3MH is muscle mass
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 On one hand, increased catabolism is expected to cause increased 3MH output,

Muscle work is generated at such high rates, that most glucose is processed
 solely through glycolysis, in the cytosol, to the three-carbon pyruvate.
 Some of the pyruvate is further oxidized in the muscle, through the tricarboxyl
ic acid cycle, but a significant amount is converted to lactate and released
 in the blood stream.
 As part of the Cori cycle, circulating lactate is reassembled into glucose
 by the liver, and re-released into the blood stream, for muscle use.
 A similar shuttling mechanism further enables muscle to rely on glycolysis,
 by transaminating excess pyruvate to the amino acid alanine, similarly
 released in the blood.
 Circulating alanine is converted by liver to glucose.
 Pyruvate transamination requires the amino acid glutamate.
 Muscle uses glutamate for other metabolic processes, including the synthesis
 of non-essential amino acids, including proline and arginine.
 Therefore, at rest, human muscle uptakes significant amounts of glutamate,
 less serine, while releasing alanine, glutamine, and smaller amounts of
 the other amino acids
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Glutamine is synthesized in muscle in order to release the excess nitrogen
 yielded by amino acid release during protein degradation.
 Muscle's glutamine is then converted by the liver to urea and excreted.
 The aforementioned amino acids, with important roles outside protein metabolism
, are not suitable for labeling and protein tracking experiments.

Among the amino acids with a trend for release between meals, isoleucine,
 leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, and valine cannot be synthesized
 by humans.
 Their net release indicates that, at rest, basal level of protein degradation
 slightly surpass protein synthesis.
 Conversely, for a steady muscle mass, there must be net protein synthesis
 in the fed state.
 Muscle protein synthesis is stimulated by feeding in multiple ways.
 One of these mechanisms employs effects of branched-chain amino acids (

 In young, healthy controls, BCAA alone were able to increase the fractional

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, the scientific community assumed, since the beginning of century, that
 atrophy is a mere reverse of hypertrophy.
 Commonly, reviews still state that atrophy, including denervation, requires
 Akt inactivation, followed by loss of downstream mTOR-mediated effects
 (for example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "zhao2007foxo3,schiaffino2013mechanisms"

\end_inset

).
 Recent studies contradicted this paradigm.
 In 2013, Quy and colleagues found that denervation increased Thr 389 phosphoryl
ation and catalytic activity of p70-S6K, indicating that denervation causes
 in fact activation of mTORC1
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "quy2013proteasome-dependent"

 In 2014, Tang and colleagues proved that rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1
 which lacks intrinsic anabolic properties, abolishes denervation-induced
 loss of muscle mass
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "tang2014mtorc1"

\end_inset

.
 These experiments prove that mTORC1 should be activated for denervation-associa
ted muscle atrophy to proceed in its later stage.
 Tang showed that denervation causes phosphorylation of insulin receptor
 substrate (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature

description "insulin receptor substrate"

\end_inset

) 1, proving that, in denervation, activated mTORC1 inhibits Akt through
 a p70-S6K - IRS 1-mediated negative feedback loop.
 Quy found that mTORC1 activation is lost upon proteasome inhibition with
 bortezomib.
 One can hypothesize the existence of an mTOR negative regulator which is
 specifically targeted by the ubiquitin-proteasome system during denervation.
 Alternatively, mTORC1 activation may be caused by the preceding uregulation
 of proteasome, which is stimulating BCAA release.
 The mechanism by which mTORC1 is stimulated by denervation remains to be
 established, but its consequences, including activation of p70-S6K, phosphoryla
tion of IRS1, inhibition of Akt, and increased Foxo activity, appear well-suport
ed by evidence.

\begin_layout Standard
Establishing the role for mTORC1 in denervation-induced loss of muscle mass
 is crucial.
 In the conceptual frame before Quy and Tang experiments, mTORC1 inhibition
 was intuitively attractive, as it would simultaneously downregulate protein
 synthesis and remove a restriction on autophagy.
 In particular, denervation-induced autophagy appealed to the muscle biologists
 of the 2000's.
 For example, one group claimed that the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine
 prevents denervation-induced muscle loss
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Others showed that denervation upregulates lysosomal enzyme cathepsin L
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 A third group claimed that denervation causes buildup of the autophagosomal
 marker, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (

\begin_layout Standard
A similar debate surrounds protein synthesis regulation in denervation.
 In Goldberg's 1969 experiment, the specific activity of the remaining muscle
 protein in denervated limbs was essentially the same as in control limbs.
 He conjectured that increased or even unchanged protein synthesis rates
 would have caused a reduction in specific activity, as new, tracer-free
 protein would build up.
 By exclusion, Goldberg concluded that denervation causes protein synthesis
 decreases, thus opening a debate that is still unsettled.
 However, Goldberg's observation could have been explained in other ways.
 For example, specific activity may be preserved if tracer amino acids increasin
gly released due to denervation would not freely diffuse out of muscle,
 but would be preferentially used in new protein.
 More recent functional studies, including some from Goldberg's group, found
 that denervation stimulates translation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "goncalves2012clenbuterol,quy2013proteasome-dependent,gomes2012upregulation,joshi2014differential,furuno1990role"

\end_inset

.
 Unlike the 1969 study, contemporary studies measured protein synthesis
 rate directly and over shorter time intervals (hours, rather than weeks).
 Both Tang and Quy found that denervation causes increased phosphorylation
 of 4E-BP, thus potentially causing protein synthesis upregulation.
 A sizable number of articles show that protein synthesis is either increased,
 decreased, or unchanged by denervation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that rapamycin has essentially no effect on adult muscle mass, it
 may be that mTOR is not the crucial effector of denervation-induced muscle
 atrophy once thought.
 Current evidence suggests that it is activated in late stages of denervation,
 with inconsequential, or perhaps compensatory, downstream activation of
 protein synthesis and inhibition of autophagy.
 In contrast, denervation-induced muscle loss is correlated systematically,
 and requires the activation of ubiquitin-proteasome system.
 The predicaments of denervation research epitomize similar dilemmas in
 the study of muscle atrophy due to other, less studied etiologies, including
 GAML.

The mechanisms by which MuRF-1 is induced are still under study.
 Transgenic mice with a defective GR still exhibit upregulated atrogenes
 in denervation and fasting, thus demonstrating the multiplicity of atrogene-sti

 A sizable body of indirect evidence suggests that the main positive regulator
 of atrogenes in GAML are FOXO transcription factors.
 Foxo transcripts are reliably upregulated by Dexa in muscle.
 In addition, Dexa may inhibit their kinase, Akt, thus protecting them from
 ubiquitination and degradation.
 Experimentally, atrogenes are also modulated by myostatin, through SMAD3
 transcription factor, and by AMPK.
 The E3 ligase TRAF6, whose expression is increased by Dexa, appears necessary

 Because HDAC 3 and 6 are repressed by Dexa and because trichostatin A,

 acts by increased histone acetylation.
 The importance of histone acetylation in in vivo GAML and the specific

 Dexa-induced inhibition of Akt is surprising, because it occurs during
 hyperinsulinemia, which causes Akt activation in normal muscle.

\begin_layout Standard
The end result of Dexa interference, inhibition of Akt, was the subject
 of debates in the 2000's.
 Proving Akt inactivation by Dexa is a complex endeavor, due to the extremely
 low Akt activation in basal state.
 Insulin or IGF-I, in concentrations close to the physiological levels,
 increase glucose uptake about 10-fold
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "weinstein1995glucocorticoid-induced"

 The fact that there is significant leeway for amplification of anabolic
 pathways demonstrates that, at basal state, muscle Akt-mediated signals
 are far below maximum.
 In immunoblots, active, that is, phosphorylated Akt is often below detection
 threshold in basal state
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "dardevet1995sensitivity"

 Unsurprisingly, observations on basal state muscle frequently failed to
 identify further repression of Akt by Dexa.
 Many studies misinterpreted this failure to detect as an actual absence
 of effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The opposite situation is also true.
 Experimental studies on the Akt pathway are conceptually challenged by
 its extremely low basal activity.
 In a molecular biology experiment, in order to prove causality by inhibition,
 one must reverse the inhibition, and observe that the final effect is lost.
 In the case of a putative inhibition of Akt by Dexa, genetic reversal of
 inhibition will never be able to merely reverse the inhibition.
 Most often, overexpression of IGF-I, IGF-1R, Akt, or other mediators on
 this pathway overcompensates Dexa's effect, thus causes overriding Akt
 activation far above the basal level.
 A long series of reports from overexpression studies mistakenly concluded
 that Akt pathway is the only mechanism by which Dexa causes atrophy, whereas
 in fact, they were describing non-specific hypertrophy.

 The latter acts on the membrane lipids to synthesize 3-phosphoinositides.

 Thus, the factors that activate Thr 308 should theoretically lead to 3-phosphoi

 In practice, Ser 473 and Thr 308 phosphorylation may occur separately,

A recent study on acute Dexa
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 opens the perspective for a paradigm-overturning situation.
 Because it failed to induce protein loss or protein degradation, its results
 may not apply to chronic GAML.
 Nevertheless, its findings are the most complete mechanistic explanation
 for Dexa-induced inhibition of mTORC1.
 In wild-type mice, Britto and colleagues found that acute Dexa caused,
 unexpectedly, hyperphosphorylation of TSC2 and Ser 473 on Akt.
 These mice exhibited lower phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, indicating that their
 mTORC1 was repressed.
 Thus, Britto concluded that Dexa-induced mTORC1 inactivation is mediated
 by PRAS40, which is left hypophosphorylated by a hypoactive Akt.
 As discussed earlier, selectivity modulations, which enable Akt to phosphorylat
e TSC2, but not PRAS40, are attributed to dissociation between Ser 473 and
 Thr 308 phosphorylation state.
 Britto found more evidence for the REDD1 - Akt - PRAS40 axis in the REDD1
 knockout mice, who are resistant to Dexa.
 In these mice, acute Dexa fails to induce hypophosphorylation on PRAS40,
 and on Thr 308 of Akt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A series of putative interaction remain to demonstrated.
 Britto speculated that Akt Ser 473 hyperphosphorylation is caused by a
 feedback loop responding to mTORC1 inhibition.
 The mechanism by which REDD1 inhibits Akt activity on PRAS40 is not known.
 Studies on transformed cells support the hypothesis that REDD1 impairs
 Akt Thr 308 phosphorylation, while proposing various pathways (

The hypothesis that REDD1 suppresses Akt and mTORC1 is very attractive,
 because, in contrast to IRS1, REDD1 would be an active and permanent repressor.

 factors

 As described in the dedicated section, HIF1a also induces VEGF, which in

While it is certain that GAML is correlated with mTORC1 downregulation,
 it is still unclear how mTORC1 repression is achieved, and what is its

 Based on the published evidence, the recent change of paradigm which placed
 p70-S6K at the forefront of denervation atrophy appears unlikely in GAML.
 For now, our understanding of GAML places Akt firmly upstream of mTORC1.
 Better transgenic models, a deeper understanding of mTOR pathways and more

Second, Foxo transcription factors are thought to be potentiated by Dexa
 through post-translational means involving the earlier-described Akt pathway
 (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 When active, Akt phosphorylates Foxo1 at Tyr 32 and Ser 253, thus creating
 binding sites for 14-3-3.
 Phosphorylated Foxo transcription factors are exported from the nucleus,
 and eventually marked for ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation.
 Intuitively, Dexa-induced impairment of Akt is expected to contribute to
 an increase in Foxo activity in GAML.
 Finding evidence for this mechanism has been challenging.

 Dexa has been frequently reported

 1969 study on cortisone-induced atrophy of rat muscle brought one more
 important theme for the field of GAML.
 In that experiment, the specific activity, that is, the ratio between tracer
 and total protein, was the same in GC-treated muscle as in control animals,
 despite decreased muscle mass and decreased total tracer in the GC-treated
 group.
 Goldberg conjectured that an equal rate of protein synthesis in the two
 groups would have caused a faster dilution of the tracer in the GC-treated
 muscle.
 Failing to find that was interpreted as evidence for decreased protein
 synthesis in cortisone-treated muscle.
 This was an elegant way of bypassing the denominator effect from the typical
 experiments, where synthesis rate would be measured over hours, in muscles
 that already underwent atrophy in the prior days.
 In these cases, a loss in protein synthesis rate might be underestimated

 on rat gastrocnemius.
 With these regimen, Testo reliably, but incompletely, reverses losses in
 body weight, muscle mass, and fiber CSA, induced by Dexa.
 Molecular pathways largely confirm an Akt centered disruption of GAML.
 Muscle IGF-I expression is repressed by Dexa, and returned to basal level
 by Testo co-administration.
 Downstream, similar AAS-induced restorations are seen in Akt phosphorylation
 at Ser 473, p70-S6K phosphorylation at Thr 389, and atrogenes expression.
 The only difference from the canonical pattern is at GSK-3β level, where
 Dexa has no effect.
 These findings are consistent with AAS-driven restoration of Foxo and mTORC1
 pathways to basal level.

 on rat muscles.
 This study is focused on the anabolic-androgenic split, and therefore compares
 levator to extraperitoneal muscles.
 At these doses, Testo co-administration restores levator ani, but not other
 muscles.
 This is a surprising finding, given that muscle atrophy caused by a higher
 Dexa dose was reversed by a much lower dose of Testo, in the study from
 Sheng and collaborators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Dalton's study, the difference between levator ani and extraperitoneal
 muscles is ascribed to the fact that Testo co-administration upregulates
 IGF-I beyond basal levels in the former, and only partially in the latter.
 Possibly as a consequence, Testo addition reduces atrogene expression to
 a larger extent in levator ani.
 In levator ani and C2C12 myotubes, Testo reverses Dexa-induced hypophosphorylat
ion of Akt (Ser 473), GSK-3β (Ser 9), FOXO3a (Ser 253), and p70-S6K (Thr

, using gastrocnemii treated as above.
 This is also the first published microarray study of GAML, generating many
 hypotheses still untested.
 Many of the genes found in the unbiased approach are consistent with the
 above description of GAML, including transcriptional reversal at the levels
 of IGFBP, IRS1, FOXO1, p85, and 4E-BP1.
 These changes point to a pleiotropic program through which AAS re-establish
 signaling on the Akt axis.
 The overlap is not perfect, with important presumptive effectors, including
 IGF-I and MAFbx, failing to pass amplitude and statistical significance
 thresholds.
 The reversal of GAML is also correlated with a repression of REDD1 to basal
 levels, suggesting that mTOR is also restored by Testo.
 Testo also reversed the surge of MuRF-1, proteasomal subunit D8, cathepsin
 L, LC3, M-type calpain, C/EBP β and δ, and metallothionein 1, exhibiting
 a wide-spectrum anti-atrophic action.

\begin_layout Chapter
Hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The example of Gadd45, at the end of the previous section, illustrates the
 issues GAML research is confronted with.
 On one hand we have macroscopic certainties, such the loss of muscle mass
 following GC therapy.
 On the other, we have invariable molecular correlates of Dexa treatment,
 such as augmented proteolysis, increased Foxo transcriptional activity,
 reduced insulin sensitivity at Akt and mTORC1 level, and upregulation of
 MuRF-1 and REDD1.
 For many of these, inhibition or interference experiments showed a reduction
 in muscle atrophy, but none was found to be indispensable for GAML.
 The hierarchy of molecular events in GAML is not known.
 Progresses made in the study of denervation atrophy, greatly favored by
 the use of transgenic models, are yet to be replicated in the study of
 GAML.
 Our understanding of androgen alleviation of GAML is even more incomplete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One reason why key mediators of GC and AAS actions have not been identified
 is the lack of transgenic models.
 Muscle-localized conditional knockout experiments are needed.
 For this purpose, studies on the most common target of genome manipulation,
 the mouse, are needed.
 Surprisingly few studies describe GAML in the mouse.
 Moreover, to my knowledge, no study of AAS alleviation of GAML in mice
 has been published.
 While some parallels with rat studies may help, higher resistance to Dexa
 in mouse suggests there must be differences.
 This work sets out to determine whether AAS can alleviate GAML in mice.
 Upon identifying the conditions that lead to GAML and to its alleviation
 by AAS, the focus will switch to understanding of the molecular mechanisms
 underlying them.
 Based on the published evidence available at the initiation of this project,
 I set forth the following hypotheses:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
1.
 Testosterone alleviates dexamethasone-induced muscle atrophy in mice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GAML has been frequently reported in rats and infrequently in mice.
 A series of studies describe reductions in CSA of mouse myofiber upon Dexa
 treatment.
 On the other hand, Testo has been used to reverse loss of muscle in mice
 and other species.
 Based on the information published prior to this work, there was a strong
 probability for Testo to prevent GC-induced loss of mouse muscle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
2.
 Testosterone's myoprotective action is based on inhibiting dexamethasone's
 proteolytic effects of dexamethasone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studies of GAML suggest that it involved a strong upregulation of proteolysis,
 aggravated by a decrease in protein synthesis.
 Protein degradation mechanisms upregulated by Dexa are diverse, including
 the proteasome, the autophagosome, and soluble proteases.
 Microarray studies showed that Testo reverses GC-induced changes in markers
 of each of the three proteolytic pathways and of protein translation.
 Given that the amplest changes induced by Dexa are on the proteasome -
 ubiquitin system, there was a good probability that specific reversal of
 GAML by Testo will include proteasome's repression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
3.
 IGF-I upregulation facilitates testosterone's myoprotective action in glucocort
icoid-induced loss of muscle mass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The few studies on GAML reversal by AAS revealed that Testo action alters
 mTOR and Akt signaling.
 Based on the microarray studies which showed that Testo reverses changes
 in IGF-I and IGFBP induced by Dexa, and on the castration reversal studies
 indicating that AAS replacement causes IGF-I upregulation, there was a
 good probability that the myoprotective action of Testo involved the modulation
 of IGF-I signaling.

 The amount of specific cDNA was estimated from the number of cycles (

\end_inset

; cycle threshold) required to reach a DNA concentration threshold, automaticall
y chosen by the Applied Biosystems software at midway between the lag phase
 and the end plateau DNA concentrations.
 Moreover, the Applied Biosystems software may interpolate the number of
 cycles, thus providing, for each well, a non-integer number of cycles that
 will yield the threshold DNA concentration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Duplicates were averaged for each unknown.
 Next, from the cycle count required to reach the threshold DNA concentration
 for the specific cDNA of interest, the cycle count for a housekeeping gene
 was subtracted, thus providing a relative measurement of expression for
 the gene of interest within the transcriptome of that animal.
 Statistics were computed on these differences, also known as ΔCt.
 To enable comparisons, these ΔCt measurements were further re-based, by
 subtracting from each the average measurement in the V group.
 (This double-rebasing method is also referred to as the 'ΔΔCt'.)

Upon finding the Dexa dose effective in inducing muscle atrophy, I analyzed
 the body weight at sacrifice.
 There was no difference between groups in terms of absolute weight, due

Based on the whole time course, I hypothesized that body weight changes
 and muscle atrophy occur in a gradual manner, with significant metabolic
 and molecular changes preceding the seven-day end of experiment.
 Accordingly, I repeated the above experiment on different cohorts of mice,
 which were sacrificed after only 1 or 3 days of treatment.
 Once more, absolute changes in body weight could not be correlated with
 the muscle changes (Fig.

, left and middle).
 When normalized, relative changes in body weight for these groups of mice

 These shorter treatments provided insight into the molecular development
 of atrophy, but, because they were run as independent experiments, they
 will not be analyzed in conjunction.
 Because this work is focused on longer-term effects of Dexa, most of the
 reported data in the remainder of the section will be either from mice
 treated for 7 days with Dexa and / or Testo, or comparisons of the 1, 3

Body composition analysis indicated that all animals included in these experimen

 There was no difference between water loss in the three experimental groups

 This uniform loss of water negates a scenario in which the observations
 could be ascribed to increased water retention due to non-specific action
 of either steroid with MR.
 In all cases, the losses of total water track the loss of lean body mass,
 indicating that muscle atrophy, rather than renal dysfunction, underlies
 the loss of water.
 Fat mass analysis indicated that in the vehicle-alone treated group, the
 rate of apparent fat gain was essentially equal with the mass of injected
 vehicle accrued over the seven days.
 This demonstrates that experiments manipulations, in the absence of pharmacolog
ical treatments, have no effect on lipid metabolism.

 Dexa injection led to rapid onset of muscle atrophy.
 Similar to humans with hypercortisolism, total body weight had limited
 use in assessing atrophy progression.
 Based on the time course of lean body mass and individual muscle changes,
 the atrophy develops throughout the first week, indicating that this murine
 model replicates chronic GC exposure.
 Some muscles are more responsive than others, with tibialis a notable refractor
y exception.

 Testo co-administration reduced the loss of muscle throughout the seven

 While rat experiments have described a series of pathways by which Dexa
 can achieve muscle atrophy, it was unclear which of them, if any, is reversed

 Therefore, Dexa's action cannot rely exclusively on translational shutdown.
 I attempted to establish which protein degradative pathways could be mediating
 the atrophic effect of dexamethasone.
 Experiments on rats suggest that Dexa causes protein degradation by stimulating
 the proteasome-ubiquitin-related transcriptional program, whereas Testo
 represses it.

In normal circumstances, the rate-limiting factor in proteasome-mediated
 protein degradation is target protein conjugation with ubiquitin, catalyzed

 Having established a model of GAML, I investigated whether the autophagy

Findings like the upregulation of LC3-II may have suggested to other authors
 that GAML relies on autophagy.
 However, the overall evidence suggests that GAML is correlated with rampant
 autophagy downregulation, while AAS co-administration has a limited effect
 on autophagy.
 Immunoblots and enzymatic assays indicated a similar disconnection between
 the calpain / calpastatin system and the AAS-induced muscle sparing (Fig.

 The ubiquitin - proteasome system emerges as the main effector of GAML
 and the main target of its alleviation by AAS.

In order to discern possible changes in protein synthesis, I investigated
 a series of its translation regulators.
 A well-documented manner of translational shutdown upon various conditions,
 such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, is phosphorylation of the initiation
 factor eIF2α by a diverse set of kinases.
 In agreement with published studies, there was no statistically significant
 change in phospho-eIF2α in the gastrocnemius of mice treated with Dexa

 A similar trend was seen in quadriceps, but the amplitude was smaller,
 perhaps owing to the fact that Dexa-induced changed in IGF-I were smaller.

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout this section, the molecular correlates of GAML, as found in rats,
 were confirmed in this novel mouse model.
 However, few of the effects of Dexa were reversed by Testo.
 Among the putative mechanisms of alleviation of GAML, there is good evidence
 for the repression of the proteasome - ubiquitin system and for restoration
 of intramuscular IGF-I.
 In the next section, I describe my efforts to better understand these myoprotec
tive mechanisms, using an in vitro model.

 The media with steroids was refreshed every 24 hours.
 The tracer was added three days before the addition of steroids, and was
 maintained in the media until 6 hours before lysis.
 Because the rate of incorporation of tracer slows down before the first

 the ratio of tracer to tracee in culture medium is equal to that in the
 pool of rapid-turnover intracellular protein.

Preliminary experiments revealed that scintillation data were not completely
 additive.
 Fortunately, the amounts of free tracer from cell extract and protein-bound
 tracer in the medium proteins are tens of times lower than the free tracer
 in the medium, and protein-bound tracer in the cells.
 In order to avoid addition of non-additive data, protein degradation rate
 was estimated from the ratio of free tracer in the cell culture medium
 to protein-bound tracer in the cell extract (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:protein-degradation-cells"

\end_inset

, middle).
 However, the results are essentially identical when free tracer from cell
 extract and protein-bound tracer in the medium proteins are taken into
 account.
 This scintillation-based method is semi-quantitative, meaning that a doubling
 of the ratio of free tracer in the cell culture medium to protein-bound
 tracer in the cell extract does not indicate a doubling in protein degradation
 rate, but merely its upregulation.

Testosterone alleviates dexamethasone-induced muscle atrophy in mice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The present work investigated the molecular mechanisms mediating androgen
 alleviation of GC-induced muscle atrophy in mouse.
 While the myoprotective action of Testo was proven in humans and dissected
 in rats, it was not studied in mice.
 In fact, although some studies investigated transcriptional changes in
 mouse muscle in response to Dexa, surprisingly few describe macroscopic
 atrophy.

 Dexa dose induced sizable loss of muscle, as evidenced by lean body mass
 and individual muscle weight changes.
 The effect was progressive, with the losses of lean body mass at day 3
 being roughly half of those at day 7.
 The observed time dependence is evidence for a Dexa-specific effect.
 Moreover, lean body mass is essentially unchanged in mice treated with
 vehicle alone.
 The measurement of fat body mass indicated that the mice treated with vehicle
 had essentially unchanged tissue fat during the experiment.
 The unchanged lean and fat tissue content is evidence for the fact that
 the experimental manipulations had no effect by themselves.
 The well-being of the study animals was further proven by the fact that
 Dexa exerted its expected stimulating action on body fat accretion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The change in total body mass was approximately equal to that in lean body
 mass.
 This may explain why body weight changes (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-course-of-body-weight"

\end_inset

), rather than body weight at sacrifice (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Body-weight-at-sacrifice"

\end_inset

), were significantly altered by Dexa.
 No other organ or tissue appeared to undergo atrophy upon Dexa treatment.
 Dissection revealed no significant changes in the size of viscera.
 No detectable changes were seen in the wet weight of the heart (data not
 shown).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gastrocnemius and quadriceps appeared as more sensitive muscle to Dexa,
 whereas tibialis was essentially unchanged.
 The lack of response in tibialis was surprising, given how common mouse
 tibialis manipulation, such as electroporation of DNA, is described in
 literature.
 All three muscles contain nearly equal masses of fast- and slow-twitch
 fibers, at least in rat
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "delp1996composition"

\end_inset

, thus excluding an explanation based on the type-specific differences in
 responsiveness.
 The lack of sensitivity in tibialis may be due to the fact that the tendinous
 component is weighing more in relative terms, compared to large fleshy
 muscles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a remarkable similarity between the in vivo and in vitro findings.
 Whereas quadriceps and gastrocnemius lost 2-3.5% of their weight for every
 day of Dexa, C2C12 myotubes lost about 5% of their total protein upon Dexa
 treatment.
 This rate is similar to that indicated by Desler for C2C12 myotubes differentia
ted over three days
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "desler1996effects"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to the in vivo studies, cells ability to thrive degraded towards
 their third day of Dexa treatment, that is, their ninth day of differentiation.
 The overarching manifestations of cell senescence prevented the assessment
 of myotube atrophy beyond the 48-hour time point.
 Moreover, the atrophic fibers' diameter becomes comparable with that of
 the nucleus (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:myotube-diameters"

\end_inset

).
 Further reductions in cell diameter would have required a shrinkage of
 the nucleus, which has not been observed in the first two days of myotube
 atrophy.
 It was therefore impossible to develop a more chronic in vitro model of
 muscle atrophy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Co-administration of Testo alleviated all macroscopic Dexa effects.
 Similar to the profile of Dexa action, in absolute terms, the recovery
 in lean body mass was approximately equal to that in total body weight.
 The percentage by which total body weight, lean body mass, and individual
 muscles recovered are similar, indicating that Testo action was also limited
 to muscle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental protocol was not ideal for observing the time course of
 the Testo action.
 On one hand, the body weight changes during the 7 day experiment (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-course-of-body-weight"

\end_inset

, top) suggests that the protective action of Testo starts early on, from
 the first day of experiment.
 On the other, the time course is not confirmed by the evolution of individual
 muscles' weight (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Muscles-weights"

\end_inset

), where 7-day samples appear effectively protected by Testo, whereas 3-day
 samples show a more limited anabolic response.
 This discrepancy originates from the fact that the mice analyzed in the
 7-day study were slightly more developed than those used in the 3-day sample,
 as indicated by the difference in levator muscles at sacrifice between
 vehicle-treated animals at each time point.
 Moreover, the detection of the Testo myoprotective effect may be strained
 by its incomplete nature.
 Because Dexa effect is progressive, its amplitude in the early stages is
 necessarily small.
 When Dexa-induced atrophy is hard to detect, its incomplete reversal will
 be even harder to demonstrate.
 One cannot exclude a temporal dissociation between the actions of the two
 steroids, but the changes surrounding the acute onset of GAML were not
 investigated in more detail, as they were beyond the scope of this work.
 At the 7-day time point, which is the most accurate model of chronic steroid
 myopathy, the alleviation of GAML is well-established.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The alleviation following Testo was incomplete in terms of lean body mass
 and individual muscle weights.
 In contrast, total body weight completely recovered.
 The source of this discrepancy is not known.
 Dissection revealed no other viscera with an appearance of hypertrophy
 following Testo co-administration.
 The dose of Testo used here was shown to be effective in rats.
 However, the Dexa dose used in the rat studies was much smaller, suggesting
 that mice studied here would have benefited even more from an increased
 dose of Testo.
 Moreover, mice may be intrinsically less responsive to Testo.
 The effective dose of Testo for fully preventing GAML should be the aim
 of future studies.
 Within the limits of present data, it may be the case that no Testo dose
 would overcome Dex-induced atrophy, which would then imply that Dexa pro-atroph
ic mechanisms include pathways outside the scope of AAS action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were differences in the responsiveness to Testo between muscle groups.
 Similar to Dexa sensitivity, an important component appears to be the tendinous
 content.
 Levator ani is more responsive to Testo than to Dexa, owing probably to
 the increased presence of AR compared to other muscles
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bentvelsen1996regulation"

\end_inset

.
 The apparent dependence of Testo response amplitude to the expression of
 AR indicates that alleviation of GAML by AAS is a specific effect, rather
 than an interaction at GR level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In vitro, myoprotective action of Testo was similarly present at late time-point
s.
 The protection of C2C12 myotubes was dose-dependent, based on the total
 protein assay.
 In a parallel to the in vivo system, the myoprotective effect was more
 salient when data was normalized to the first time point in the experiment
 (fig.

\begin_layout Section
Testosterone's myoprotective action is based on the inhibition of the dexamethas
one-induced proteasome upregulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mouse model of GAML largely replicated what was known from rat experiments,
 where a strong upregulation of the proteasome system is seconded by alterations
 in protein synthesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In vivo, the E3 ligases also known as atrogenes were upregulated.
 The upregulation of MuRF-1 was precocious, strong, and reached statistical
 significance despite the small sample size.
 Upregulation of MuRF-1 was confirmed at early stages in gastrocnemius,
 quadriceps, and triceps (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Atrogenes-expression"

\end_inset

; the latter not shown).
 In agreement with published studies, the more specific ligase, MAFbx, was
 upregulated by a lesser percentage than MuRF-1.
 In combination with the practical limitations on sample sizes, the low-grade
 activation of MAFbx strained its detection to a statistically significant
 degree in this experiment.
 Nevertheless, the invariable trend across muscle groups towards increased
 MAFbx expression in response to Dexa indicates that the second atrogene
 was also part of the atrophic transcriptional program.
 The massive proteasome upregulation observed in day 3 samples increased
 the probability of the hypothetical scenario in which protein degradation
 is limited by proteasome availability, rather than E3 ligases.
 However, day 3 also marks the peak of proteasome catalytic activity (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Proteasome-enzymatic-activity"

\end_inset

).
 The synchronized stimulation of the proteasome and of the atrogenes indicates
 that the proteasome - ubiquitin system is at the center of GAML.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All these catabolic catabolic changes were inhibited by Testo co-administration.
 In vitro, atrogenes expression was reduced to basal levels, and, in the
 case of day 7 samples, even further below.
 The inhibitory effect of Testo on MuRF-1 was predicted by the microarray
 study on rat muscle.
 Similar to the rat study, the changes in MAFbx were also in agreement with
 the phenotype, but of a lesser amplitude.
 In addition, the proteasome activity was suppressed at its day 3 peak.
 This aspect of muscle atrophy, already demonstrated as a component of male
 post-castration muscle atrophy

 It is unclear how Dexa achieves this upregulation.
 In this experiment, limited exploration found no upregulation of transcripts
 for proteasome subunits A6, B10, or D4 (data not shown).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In vitro, proteasome inhibition led to nearly complete suppression of proteolysi
s, beyond the basal levels seen in vehicle-treated cells.
 This finding indicates that most of the proteolytic activity in C2C12 cells
 is dependent on the proteasome.

\begin_layout Standard
A study by Baehr and colleagues
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "baehr2011muscle"

\end_inset

, which was published while my experiments were under way, showed that MAFbx
 knockout did not reduce the amplitude of GAML, while MuRF-1 knockout reduced
 GAML to about half of its amplitude in wild-type mice.
 My data show that, instead of rejecting the proteasome-centered model of
 GAML, future studies should focus on finding alternative ways by which
 the proteasome performs its catabolic function.
 For example, the simplest scenario fitting today's data is one where the
 proteasome performs the clearance of the bulk of dispensable proteins.
 An alternative explanation, which takes into account the subsiding evolution
 of the atrogene surge, is that atrogenes ubiquitinate, and target for degradati
on, an yet unidentified myoprotective intracellular factor, thus unleashing
 a cascade of proteasome-independent mechanisms.
 Some limited attempts to detect multiple ubiquitination states for MuRF-1's
 putative substrate, myosin heavy chain, have failed (data not shown).
 If MuRF-1 has only this limited and limiting action, disruption of MuRF-1
 in Baehr's knockout mice could have been supplanted by partially homologous
 genes, such as MuRF-2 or Fbxo40
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "shi2011scf-fbxo40,witt2005murf-1"

\end_inset

.
 The distinction between the two scenarios is difficult, especially in the
 in vivo approach.
 In either scenario, the role of the proteasome is indispensable for GAML.
 Proteasome inhibition by Testo co-administration emerges as an important
 mechanism of GAML alleviation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiments performed in this study clearly exclude a role for autophagosome
 - lysosome system in digestion of bulk myofiber proteins.
 The in vivo data indicate a persistent suppression of autophagy-related
 genes across muscle groups and time points.
 Moreover, lysosome-associated cathepsin L enzymatic activity is suppressed
 by Dexa in a statistically significant manner at all time points.
 The downregulation of cathepsin activity and expression was more ample
 than the the loss of muscle protein, indicating that an active process
 of cathepsin degradation is activated by Dexa in vivo.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The finding of Dexa-induced autophagy downregulation was unexpected.
 Some atrophic conditions, most notably starvation, lead to autophagy regulation.
 The rat microarray findings found cathepsin L among the set of genes upregulate
d by Dexa.
 Even in this study, a narrow measurement, the accumulation of lipidated
 LC3 appeared upregulated by Dexa (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LC3-hyperlipidated"

\end_inset

, middle).
 However, the microarray results were never validated by qRT-PCR.
 In the present work, when the hyperlipidated LC3 form is normalized to
 its precursor, its levels become essentially unchanged in response to Dexa
 (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LC3-hyperlipidated"

\end_inset

, right).
 The accumulation of LC3 protein, both in precursor and mature form, indicates
 reduced capacity in the autophagolysosome compartment, especially in the
 present context of downregulated LC3 protein expression.
 This line of evidence corroborates with the downregulated enzymatic activity
 to refute a putative role for autophagy in bulk GAML.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intuitively, it is more likely for bulk protein catabolism to be mediated
 by the smaller proteasome and atrogenes than the larger autophagosome.
 However, autophagy may play a regulatory, initiating role in GAML.
 In the in vivo studies, the amplitude and invariability of autophagy inhibition
 prove its modulation by Dexa.
 One could speculate that such changes, ampler than those in muscle mass,
 cannot be simple inconsequential side effects.
 While the present data solidly exclude a role for bulk protein digestion,
 further studies are needed to elucidate which proteins are spared from
 autophagy during GAML, and what is the regulatory effect of their sparing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the in vivo data suggested that downregulation of autophagy is part
 of GAML, I found the opposite phenomenon in cell culture experiments.
 There, inhibition of lysosomes with chloroquine had a significant protective
 effect.
 The differences between the in vivo and in vitro data reveal the incompleteness
 of the cell culture model.
 Many factors absent from the cell culture experiment could have caused
 the observed contrast, including myoprotective influences of the motoneuron
 and vascularization.
 Moreover, the advanced quiescence of the cultured myotubes contrasts with
 the ample in vivo ability to regenerate.
 Given the reductionism of the culture cell experiment, the in vivo experiment
 is likely more reflective of what occurs in human glucocorticoid myopathy.
 The fact that Testo reversed most of the in vivo effects of Dexa on autophagy
 suggest that this pathway requires deeper study.
 The role of autophagy in GAML will be better understood by using LC3-GFP
 transgenic mice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prior to this work, the calpain system was the least likely effector of
 GAML.
 In agreement with the literature, this study could not substantiate Dexa-induce
d changes in calpain enzymatic activity, calpain, or calpastatin protein
 levels (data not shown).
 Overall, the absence of Dexa-induced amplification in catabolic activity
 in the cathepsin and calpain pathways reduces the scope for AAS myoprotection
 through inhibition of these pathways.
 Moreover, Testo had no reliable effect on the Dexa-induced changes in the
 autophagosome - lysosome pathway.
 Therefore, Testo protection is not mediated by inhibition of cathepsin
 or calpain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studies on protein synthesis rate have been strained by the limited technical
 abilities of measuring protein synthesis in mice.
 No study measured changes in the rate of protein synthesis in mice prior
 to this work.
 The studies on rats indicated that such measurements are fraught with high
 variability, and will likely fail to detect any effect.
 I did not measure protein synthesis directly in vivo.
 The measurements of protein synthesis rate in vitro failed to identify
 any significant change in response to Dexa.
 C2C12 cells are surprisingly dependent on protein synthesis, with either
 translational inhibitor cycloheximide and puromycin leading to cell death
 and detachment in hours (data not shown).
 Overall the lack of detectable changes in protein synthesis rate agrees

In order to detect subtle changes in protein synthesis, I investigated a
 series of its regulators.
 I failed to identify changes in levels of phosphorylated eIF2α and eIF3f
 in response to either Dexa or Testo (Figs.

reference "fig:Phosphorylated-eif2"

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 I could not detect ATF4 protein in muscle lysates (data not shown).
 In the 7-day samples, both total and phosphorylated 4E-BP were upregulated
 by Dexa.
 With these data, it was unclear whether the active negative regulator of
 protein synthesis, unphosphorylated 4E-BP was increased or decreased by
 chronic Dexa.
 The changes in total and phosphorylated 4E-BP induced by Testo are small,
 and cannot lead to increased inactivation of 4E-BP.
 Therefore, there was no evidence that, at 7-day time point, the protective
 action of Testo benefits from increased protein synthesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the reported experiments were ongoing, Baehr and colleagues reported
 that Dexa decreased protein synthesis rate at day 3 and increased it at
 day 14 in mouse triceps
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Baehr et al.
 findings suggest that acute Dexa represses protein synthesis, whereas chronic
 Dexa is associated with a compensatory restoration of translational capacities.
 At the 7-day time point analyzed in this study, a measurement of protein
 synthesis by Baehr's method would have been indecisive, as the muscle would
 have been midway in the switch from low translation to high translation
 rate.

In agreement with the rat studies, the present work demonstrates that Dexa-induc
ed upregulation of atrogenes is co-ordinated with increased transcription
 of Foxo transcription factors (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Foxo-expression"

\end_inset

, top).
 Foxo3a surge was even more precocious than the increase in MuRF-1, with
 a statistically significant presence in day 1 samples.
 Moreover, the transcription factor Klf15, which is a target of Foxo transcripti
on factor, and their synergistic partner in the upregulation of MuRF-1,
 underwent an equally rapid intensification (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Foxo-expression"

\end_inset

, bottom).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed in the literature review section, at least five ways by which
 Dexa stimulates Foxo transcriptional activity have been demonstrated.
 On the other hand, in the present work, I show that atrogenes' upregulation
 is repressed by Testo co-administration.
 The means by which Testo achieves atrogene repression are less understood.
 Here, I demonstrate that Testo-induced downregulation of atrogenes is correlate
d with reduced transcription of Foxo3a.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inhibitory phosphorylation of 4E-BP is induced by mTORC1.
 I also investigated changes in REDD1 / Ddit4, the negative regulator of
 mTORC1.
 Dexa consistently upregulated REDD1 expression in samples from days 1,
 3, and 7.
 However, the 7-day time point were associated with a less ample REDD1 amplifica
tion.
 A time course where REDD1 is amplified only for the first week, and subsides
 later, could explain Baehr's observations on protein synthesis time line.
 Testo co-administration reversed REDD1 upregulation only at 7-day time
 point, when Dexa-induced amplification was at its lowest.
 The implication is that, at later time points, Testo co-administration
 may become able to remove the breaks from mTORC1 and protein synthesis.
 Further experiments are needed to analyze such putative changes in protein
 synthesis at later time points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another mechanism for Testo-induced repression of is mediated by Akt, the
 kinase that labels Foxo to degradation.
 Foxo phosphorylation by Akt is stimulated by the latter's Ser 473 phosphorylati
on, which is catalyzed by mTORC2, typically when cells are stimulated with
 growth factors, insulin, or nutrients.
 In this study, I observed that Testo stimulated IGF-I expression at all
 time points.
 However, when I analyzed 7-day samples, I found that Dexa reduced the amount
 of phosphorylated, that is, active Akt, whereas an opposite of Testo on
 Akt Ser 473 phosphorylation could not be observed
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Akt-phosphorylation"

\end_inset

.
 The absence of Akt response is in contrast with observations made in rats.
 The reported mouse study differs from the rat study in the Dexa dose, which
 was much smaller.
 The higher dose of Dexa led to significant fat accumulation in the studied
 mice (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Changes-in-water-lean-and-fat"

\end_inset

).
 One can speculate that, in these mice, Dexa might have induced even stronger
 hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and IRS-1 sequestration
 in the cytosol, compared to the rats from other reports.
 These might have interfered with IGF-I signals to a degree that reduced
 Testo action below detectability threshold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Final considerations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This work demonstrates that Testo protects mouse muscle in vivo and in vitro
 by reversing the Dexa-induced upregulation of proteasome.
 In contrast to the expectations set by the microarray studies, there was
 no evidence for bulk protein digestion through the autophagosome.
 However, Dexa and Testo significantly modulate autophagy, possibly achieving
 regulatory effects.
 The role of autophagy in GAML and its reversal by AAS must be clarified
 by studies on LC3-GFP mice.
 Dexa and Testo modulate in opposite manner the transcription of Foxo and
 Klf15 transcription factors.
 Moreover, the two steroid hormones regulate the mTOR inhibitor REDD1.
 More transgenic studies are required to establish the relative importance,
 and the eventual interaction between Foxo and mTOR pathways.
