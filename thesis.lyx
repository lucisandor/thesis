Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Glucocorticoids (GC) are used widely for the treatment of a large number
 of inflammatory conditions.
 Loss of muscle mass and muscle weakness are common complications of GC
 therapy.
 Androgen therapy has been suggested to reverse GC-associated muscle loss
 (GAML), but evidence of its effectiveness is lacking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, I established a mouse model of GAML.
 Young adult male mice receiving 0.25 mg/day dexamethasone (D) s.c.
 daily, for a week, lost 3% of their body weight.
 Through NMR lean body mass quantification and muscle dissection, a loss
 of more than 10% of their muscle mass was lost.
 More than half of the muscle loss was reversed by co-administration of
 0.7 mg/day testosterone (T).
 This is the first mouse model of GAML alleviation by T.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intramuscular atrogene expression and proteasome catalytic activity were
 upregulated by D and suppressed by T co-administration.
 T co-administration caused intramuscular downregulation of atrogene-activating
 Foxo transcription factors.
 Intramuscular pro-autophagic REDD1 and Klf15 were repressed by T co-administrat
ion.
 T co-administration reduced the autophagosome-characteristic lipidated
 form of LC3B.
 Translation regulators 4E-BP, eIF3f and eIF2 did not change significantly
 as a result of androgen co-administration.
 Calpains activity and levels were unchanged by D and T.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
C2C12 differentiated myotubes were used to determine the effects of T and
 D on protein synthesis and degradation.
 Myotube diameters were reduced by D, while T co-administration suppressed
 D effect.
 Protein degradation was increased by 24 hour D treatment.
 D-stimulated protein degradation was inhibited by proteasomal inhibitor
 MG132, and, to a lesser degree, by lysosome inhibitor chloroquine.
 T co-administration returned protein degradation to basal levels.
 Protein synthesis response to D and T did not correlate with the observed
 phenotypes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In vivo, D reduced intramuscular IGF-I expression, an effect reversed by
 T co-administration.
 In C2C12, inhibition of IGF-1R signaling with picropodophyllin did not
 modify T effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, T protective action in GAML is mainly anti-catabolic, through
 reversal of proteasome and autophagosome upregulation induced by D.
 T stimulates a potentially protective intramuscular IGF-I response.
 Different models are needed to determine the role of protein synthesis
 and of IGF-I in GAML.

Cushing's syndrome
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through the detailed case series written by Harvey Cushing
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "cushing1912pituitary"

\end_inset

, the scientific and medical community became aware of an otherwise rare
 disease, which bears his name.
 Unlike the earlier and better-studied deficiencies of the thyroid and pancreas,
 pituitary defects were more variable in manifestation and therefore harder
 to unify in a single clinical entity.
 Even when macroscopic hypertrophy of pituitary were localized to a gland
 subdomain, it was unclear whether observed pathology could be attributed
 to a hypersecretion from the hypertrophied sector, or to a deficiency in
 the neighboring compressed structures.
 Similarly, pituitary extracts caused multiple, and even opposite effects,
 in animal models
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "schafer1899physiological"

\end_inset

, suggestive of a mixture of hormones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among 50 cases described by Cushing, about five stood out due to the involvement
 of other glands.
 In each of them, and, to a lesser extent, in a few more cases, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hyperadrenalism
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was blamed for asthenia, hyperpigmentation of skin, low blood pressure,
 and hypoglycemia.
 Histopathology tests localized the adrenal abnormalities to the zona fasciculat
a of the cortex.
 Cushing wrote that some of these abnormalities, reflect current adrenal
 hypoactivity, caused by exhaustion after preceding intense stimulation
 and hyperactivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Twenty years later, Cushing narrowed the focus in an updated case series
 of combined pituitary-adrenal pathology
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cushing1932basophil"

\end_inset

.
 Cushing noted that basophile adenomata of the pituitary and hypertrophy
 of the adrenal glands often coexisted.
 Based on the curative effect of pituitary surgery, he hypothesized that
 the adrenal defect is secondary to the pituitary abnormality.
 In turn, he inferred that the adrenal changes mediate the disease phenotype,
 which includes obesity with ectopic adipose deposits, kyphosis, amenorrhoea
 / impotence, hypertrichosis, lineae atrophicae, fatigability and weakness.
 Among these disease manifestations, muscle impairment was a serious, if
 variable, component.
 Cushing considered intense muscle loss the cause of death for one of these
 cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cushing's work did little to elucidate mechanisms leading to the phenotype.
 The variability in pituitary changes between the cases he described meant
 that many scientists rejected his hypothesis of pituitary primacy.
 A group at the Mayo Clinic was actively pursuing the opposite hypothesis,
 with the adrenal as the primary site of impairment in adrenal-pituitary
 combined afflictions
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kepler1949cushings"

\end_inset

.
 On the clinical side, it was noted that some of Cushing's patients lacked
 observable pituitary changes.
 Moreover, some of the Mayo patients were cured by adrenal surgery.
 From a theoretical perspective, the adrenal hypothesis was more tempting
 because the adrenal deficiency (termed Addison's disease) and its reversal
 by administration of adrenal cortex extracts were better known than pituitary
 pathology
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today, we know that the truth was more nuanced.
 Oversecretion of the adrenal cortex hormones cortisol and / or corticosterone
 is termed hypercortisolism.
 One or more clinical signs listed by Cushing (see above) suggest to the
 practitioner the activation of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "HPA"
description "hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal"

\end_inset

) axis.
 If concomitant hypercortisolism is confirmed by an increase of urine free
 cortisol measurements, or by the effacement of the evening trough in circulatin
g cortisol, there is suspicion for Cushing's syndrome (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "CS"
description "Cushing's syndrome"

\end_inset

)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "nieman2008diagnosis"

\end_inset

.
 Some hypercortisolism cases, termed pseudo-Cushing's syndrome, are ascribed
 to causes outside the HPA axis, such as in depression, morbid obesity,
 uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and sleep apnea (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "nieman2002diagnostic"

\end_inset

).
\begin_inset Note Greyedout
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In theory, pseudo-Cushing responds to suppression tests by low dose Dexa,
 while true CS does not.
 In practice, specificity is very low and sensitivity is 95%, so latest
 guidelines are recommending against suppression tests.
 Tumors may be less responsive in Dexa suppression and in ACTH stimulation
 tests than hyperplasias per PMID: 4342889
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
True CS cases are further classified based on the role of the adrenal-stimulatin
g pituitary hormone corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone; 
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "ACTH"
description "adrenocorticotropic hormone;"

\end_inset

).
 In some CS patients, hypercortisolism is paralleled by an increase in ACTH.
 Their adrenals are usually responsive to further ACTH stimulation tests,
 indicating that previously intact adrenals underwent hyperplasia in response
 to a pathological overstimulation with ACTH.
 When attributed to the pituitary, such ACTH oversecretion, followed by
 secondary hypercortisolism, is termed Cushing's disease (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kirk2000cushings"

\end_inset

).
 Cushing's disease remains a staple of physiology textbooks, because it
 provides an excellent didactic example of a hormone hierarchy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of CS cases consists of hypercortisolism in spite of low ACTH.
 In primary hypercortisolism, ACTH is typically suppressed by negative feedback.
 Adrenal neoplasms are are the most frequent cause of primary hypercortisolism.
 Ectopic or diffuse unregulated sources of ACTH or cortisol may cause hypercorti
solism.
 In recent decades, overdose with synthetic derivatives of cortisol became
 the most important cause of low-intensity CS (discussed in the next section).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite being caused by a diverse set of HPA pathologies, CS is quite invaiable
 in its ability to cause muscle impairment.

\begin_layout Section
Glucocorticoid therapy

\begin_layout Standard
A series of serendipitous decisions brought impressive knowledge about CS
 of non-pituitary etiology (reviewed in
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "glyn1998discovery"

\end_inset

).
 First, during World War II, US intelligence learned that Germans were importing
 large quantities of adrenal glands from neutral Argentina.
 This reignited US government interest in corticoadrenal research, despite
 the lackluster results with earlier adrenal extracts.
 At the end of the war, only a few grams of pure adrenal steroids were manufactu
red, from endogenous sources and at a high cost.
 The second opportunity was in the allocation of those scarce steroids.
 One of them, cortisone, made by Merck, was shared by a few clinical researchers
, including Phillip Hench.
 Hench's request was based on his previous work on rheumatoid arthritis.
 He observed that rheumatoid arthritis was alleviated in jaundice, and hypothesi
zed the existence of a steroidal 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

anti-rheumatoid factor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Third, Hench's choice of dose and route elicited an extraordinary reversal
 in arthritic pain and dysfunction.
 In 1949, after treating only five patients
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hench1964reversibility"

\end_inset

, impressive improvements in those cases triggered redirected corticosteroid
 research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous work did describe multiple effects for adrenal extracts, but little
 was known about purer preparations, such as cortisone.
 In fact, adrenal research was discouraged prior to cortisone purification,
 because less pure extracts combined antagonistic hormones in variable doses,
 leading to the impression that they lack a defined pharmacological effect.
 However, even with purified cortisone, Hench saw a very diverse set of
 consequences for cortisone administration

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, cortisone's action on metabolism was accessible even to the less
 sophisticated clinical measurements used 60 years ago.
 Patients receiving cortisone gained weight.
 Chronic cortisone therapy led to accumulation of adipose tissue, often
 in ectopic locations, such as the interscapular

 Cortisone also induced hyperglycemia which can induce glycosuria.
 For this reason, cortisone, and its endogenous and synthetic analogs, are
 grouped in the glucocorticoid (

Hench and collaborators hypothesized that cortisone's protective action
 is not limited to rheumatoid arthritis.
 In his 1950 Nobel lecture, Hench envisaged a role for alleviation of most
 inflammatory diseases.
 GCs share the ability to reduce inflammation (reviewed in

 Some of these anti-inflammatory effects, such as reduction in the number

 The cellular and molecular anti-inflammatory mechanisms are still subject
 of active research.

The knowledge gap around the anti-inflammatory actions of GCs is in part
 caused by the immunology progress.
 Still, some questions remain open, and illustrate the convoluted ways in
 which GC signals are relayed in the cell.
 For example, GCs are often acting in a manner shared with all steroids,
 by binding and activating the glucocorticoid receptor (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "GR"

).
 Activated GR translocates from cytosol to the nucleus, where it dimerizes
 on specific DNA sequences, termed glucocorticoid responsive-elements (

 The classical effect of the GRE-GR interaction is increased transcription
 for neighboring target genes (transactivation), as it is the case in polymorpho
nucleate cells with interleukin 1 (

 In other circumstances, the activated receptor inhibits transcription directly
 (transrepression), or by interfering with transcription factors.
 For example, in human T lymphocytes, GCs inhibit the transcription factor
 activator protein 1 (

 Taking into account the large variability between trials and the use of
 a atypical population, the comparison is of marginal use, but it does not
 appear that the combination (Dexa + bortezomib) is more muscle protective
 than Dexa alone.
 Clinical studies directly addressing this comparison in patients prescribed
 high-dose GC are recommended, given that the most commonly accepted hypothesis
 centers on the proteasome as main effector of GC-induced muscle loss.
 It is still more likely to find that bortezomib provides muscle protection.
 Proving a beneficial action of bortezomib in co-administration with GC
 will have major practice implications.
 Even proving the opposite, that bortezomib has no protective action, will
 be very valuable in better understanding and eventually preventing GC-induced

 endorsement for semen therapy.
 Instead, due to the semen taboo, Brown-SÃ©quard and his disciples resorted
 to surrogate interventions, such as vasectomy, believed to preserve sperm

 The introduction of injections gave a new lease of life to the therapeutic
 use of organ extracts, called

 Some organotherapies were shams or even harmful.
 Yet a few of them provided evidence that specific parts of the body store
 or release into the blood stream chemicals, which subsequently induce changes
 in other specific parts of the body.
 This conjecture led the discovery of endocrine glands and the establishment
 of endocrinology as a science.

 Naturally, one of the conditions associated with loss of muscle mass that
 clinicians hoped to improve was hypercortisolism.

During the 1950's, AAS became part of the standard of care for endogenous
 hypercortisolism during the gap between diagnosis and curative surgery.
 However, this gap narrowed to a few weeks, due to improvements in differential
 diagnosis.
 Development of accurate cortisol assays allowed the measurement of its
 changes in response to Dexa, thus discriminating conditions where feedback
 mechanisms fail (mainly endocrine neoplasms) from cortisol-stimulating
 non-endocrine conditions.
 ACTH assays differentiate ACTH-independent cases (typically adrenal tumors)
 from the ACTH-dependent ones (usually localized in the pituitary).
 Modern imaging, including computed tomography of the adrenal and magnetic
 resonance imaging of the pituitary, identify the target of surgery.
 AAS therapy is now confined to inoperable cases, including unidentified
 ectopic sources of ACTH or cortisone.
 Even these cases benefit from more targeted interventions (see

 However, their study differs in key aspects from the other studies and
 the medical practice.
 They tested a variable, moderate dose of Testo on normogonadal older men,
 with the goal of maintaining a physiological Testo level.
 Moderate Testo therapy caused an improvement in muscle mass, strength,
 and net protein balance.
 However, they failed to observe an improvement in protein FSR, and concluded
 that the net protein balance improvement must be caused by T-induced inhibition
 of protein degradation.
 The failure to detect protein synthesis rate changes indicates that, perhaps
 due to unusual treatments, this study yielded unusual outcomes, which cannot

For the most part, the skeletal muscles confers the three-dimensional intricate
 conformation of the body, suggesting a complex, detailed organization,
 at least at macroscopic level.
 In contrast, at cell level, the relatively high specialization of the skeletal
 muscle leaves little space for diversity or inhomogeneity.
 Skeletal muscles are organized in anatomical units that may impose a force
 on two moving body segments (typically, bones), determining them to come
 closer to each other.
 This specificity of action is ensured by the presence of distinct, well-determi
ned insertion points, to which skeletal muscles are attached by the means
 of tendons and aponeuroses (reviewed in

The tendons are dense connective tissue structure, which extend into the
 epimysium, a connective tissue sheath surrounding the muscle.
 In turn, epimysium emits connective septing structures termed perimysium,
 splitting muscles into subunits termed fascicles.
 At an even lower level, a thin, sparse connective structure called endomysium
 coats each polynucleate, elongated cell (termed myofiber).
 Connective tissue supports the terminal branches of the nervous, circulatory
 and lymphatic systems.
 In addition, connective tissue inside the muscle provides mechanical anchoring
 between fibers, longitudinally, laterally and with the tendons.
 This is particularly true of perimysium, whose collagen content is 95%

The myofiber is the histological base unit of contractile tissue.
 Another muscle-specific population of cells comprises the mononuclear,

Each myofiber is a syncytium, that forms and grows by fusion with neighboring

 The only way to acquire nuclei to the myofibers is fusion with surrounding

 The apparent sensitivity of actin to muscle mass regulators poses a technical

 If, in an atrophying muscle, some protein of interest is depleted faster
 than actin, immunoblots will convey the certainty that the former is downregula

 But if the protein of interest is lost in a less preferential manner, at
 the same rate with actin, immunoblots normalized to actin will convey the

Muscle work is generated at such high rates, that most glucose is processed
 solely through glycolysis, in the cytosol, to the three-carbon pyruvate.
 Some of the pyruvate is further oxidized in the muscle, through the tricarboxyl
ic acid cycle, but a significant amount is converted to lactate and released
 in the blood stream.
 As part of the Cori cycle, circulating lactate is reassembled into glucose
 by the liver, and re-released into the blood stream, for muscle use.
 A similar shuttling mechanism further enables muscle to rely on glycolysis,
 by transaminating excess pyruvate to the amino acid alanine, similarly
 released in the blood.
 Circulating alanine is converted by liver to glucose.
 Pyruvate transamination requires the amino acid glutamate.
 Muscle uses glutamate for other metabolic processes, including the synthesis
 of non-essential amino acids, including proline and arginine.
 Therefore, at rest, human muscle uptakes significant amounts of glutamate,
 less serine, while releasing alanine, glutamine, and smaller amounts of
 the other amino acids
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

Among the amino acids with a trend for release between meals, isoleucine,
 leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, and valine cannot be synthesized

 Their net release indicates that, at rest, basal level of protein degradation

 Conversely, for a steady muscle mass, there must be net protein synthesis
 in the fed state.
 Feeding status is relayed to the muscle by a surge in insulin and, independentl

 acids (

 In young, healthy controls, BCAA alone were able to increase the fractional

 Indeed, in the same muscle, p70-S6K was activated, as indicated by an increase
 in its Thr 389 phosphorylated form.
 Another substrate of mTORC1, 4E-BP, was hyperphosphorylated.
 The action of mTORC1 on 4E-BP is the canonical way in which the former
 stimulates protein synthesis, by abolishing the latter's ability to bind
 and inhibit the mandatory translation initiation factor eIF4E.

 Recent studies contradicted this paradigm.
 In 2013, Quy and colleagues found that denervation increased Thr 389 phosphoryl

 in fact activation of mTORC1
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In 2014, Tang and colleagues proved that rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1
 which lacks intrinsic anabolic properties, abolishes denervation-induced
 loss of muscle mass
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "tang2014mtorc1"

 These experiments prove that mTORC1 should be activated for denervation-associa

 Tang showed that denervation causes phosphorylation of insulin receptor
 substrate (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

\end_inset

) 1, proving that, in denervation, activated mTORC1 inhibits Akt through
 a p70-S6K - IRS 1-mediated negative feedback loop.
 Quy found that mTORC1 activation is lost upon proteasome inhibition with
 bortezomib.
 One can hypothesize the existence of an mTOR negative regulator which is
 specifically targeted by the ubiquitin-proteasome system during denervation.
 However, the late timing of the Akt / mTOR involvement suggests that the
 most plausible explanation places mTOR activation after the proteasome
 releases significant amounts of free amino acids.
 It is therefore more likely that denervation-induced mTOR activation is
 caused by the proteasome-stimulated amino acid release.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Establishing the role for mTORC1 in denervation-induced loss of muscle mass
 is crucial.
 In conceptual frame before Quy and Tang experiments, mTORC1 was thought
 as being inactivated by denervation, thus downregulating on protein synthesis
 and removing a restriction on autophagy.
 This hypothesis was conceptually attractive, because it implied a co-operation
 between multiple anabolic and catabolic pathways, towards achieving muscle
 loss.
 In particular, denervation-induced autophagy appealed to the muscle biologists
 of the 2000's.
 For example, in a never-replicated experiment, one group claimed that the
 lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine prevents denervation-induced muscle loss
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Others showed that denervation upregulates lysosomal enzyme cathepsin L

A similar debate surrounds protein synthesis regulation in denervation.
 In Goldberg's 1969 experiment, the specific activity of the remaining muscle
 protein was essentially the same as in control limbs.
 Increased or even unchanged protein synthesis rates would have caused a
 reduction in specific activity.
 Therefore, Goldberg concluded that denervation causes protein synthesis
 decreases, thus opening a debate that is still unsettled.
 Goldberg's observed reduction in protein synthesis rate is consistent with
 an indiscriminate loss of translation initiation and elongation factors,
 as much as with an active mechanism of protein synthesis cessation.
 Moreover, more recent functional studies, including some from Goldberg's
 group, found that denervation stimulates translation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "goncalves2012clenbuterol,quy2013proteasome-dependent,gomes2012upregulation,joshi2014differential,furuno1990role"

 Unlike the 1969 study, contemporary studies measured protein synthesis
 rate directly and over shorter time intervals (hours, rather than weeks).
 As in the case of autophagy, follow-up studies found molecular changes
 in regulators of translation, in some cases supporting a regulated, denervation
-triggered mechanism of protein translation shutoff, in others refuting
 them.
 Both Tang and Quy found that denervation causes increased phosphorylation
 of 4E-BP, thus leading to stimulation of protein synthesis.
 Both also show that the effect on 4E-BP is prevented by rapamycin, demonstratin
g that protein synthesis is upregulated through an mTOR-dependent mechanism.

, it may be that mTOR is not the crucial effector of denervation-induced
 muscle loss once thought.
 Recent studies show that its activation, and the downstream net anabolic
 effects it elicits through autophagy and translation, cannot explain the
 observed phenotype.
 Denervation-induced muscle loss is, to great extent, produced by the ubiquitin-
proteasome system.
 Better experiments are needed in order to understand autophagy and of mTOR
 in denervation-induced muscle loss.
 The irreconcilable differences between functional and molecular studies
 of denervation epitomize similar predicaments in the study of muscle atrophy
 due to other etiologies, including the less-explored GAML.

 This suggests that MAFbx may be an initiator, neutralizing a few specific

 A sizable body of indirect evidence suggests that the main positive regulator
 of atrogenes in GAML are FOXO transcription factors.
 These transcription factors are reliably upregulated by Dexa in muscle.
 In addition, Dexa inhibits their kinase, Akt, thus protecting them from
 ubiquitination and degradation.
 Atrogenes are also modulated by myostatin, through SMAD3 transcription
 factor, and by AMPK.
 Transgenic mice with a defective GR still exhibit upregulated atrogenes
 in denervation and fasting.
 Therefore, atrogenes integrate a multitude of GC-activated and GC-independent
 metabolic and hormonal signals (discussed in dedicated sections).

 Because atrogenes promoters contain putative binding sites for C/EBP transcript

 GC stimulate atrogenes.
 Interestingly, p300 is a histone acetyltransferase (

 Dexa increases HAT activity and reduces HDAC activity in muscle

 Because HDAC 3 and 6 are repressed by Dexa and because trichostatin A,
 an HDAC inhibitor, upregulates MAFbx, it has been hypothesized that Dexa
 acts by increased histone acetylation.
 The studies are interesting opening move in the field of epigenetics, and
 should be followed up with identification of specific chromatin loci and
 / or extranuclear proteins whose acetylation is modulated by Dexa.
 The importance of histone acetylation in in vivo GAML is still to be determined.

In conclusion, explant models suggest that GAML is, to a wide extend, the
 result of upregulation of the proteasome-ubiquitin system.

 flux and their intracellular localization

 Judging by the significant residual atrophy after depletion or inhibition
 of the atrogenes, other mechanisms, within and outside the ubiquitin-proteasome

 Each of them has proteasome-unrelated side effects, including activation

 The fact that there is significant leeway for amplification of anabolic
 pathways demonstrates that, at basal state, muscle Akt-mediated signals
 are diminished.
 Unsurprisingly, investigations of muscle in basal state have been prone
 to fail to observe changes in Akt-related signals.
 Moreover, studies on the Akt pathway are conceptually challenged by the
 low basal activity.
 In order to prove causality by downstream inhibition, one must reverse
 that inhibition, and establish that the final effect is lost.
 Chemical reversal of inhibition is rarely an option.
 In the case of Akt, genetic reversal of inhibition, that is, overexpression
 studies, have minute chances of matching wildtype basal level.
 Most often, overexpression of IGF-I, IGF-1R, Akt, or other mediators of
 GAML overcompensates Dexa's effect, and causes overriding, possibly non-specifi

In conclusion, the muscle response to GC is associated with signaling and
 glucose metabolism changes consistent with IRS and Akt loss of sensitivity
 to trophic factors such as insulin and IGF-I.
 Interestingly, the pathway appears largely unaffected by Dexa in basal

 Because the model of GAML centered on Akt is derived from experiments with
 acute states, cell models, and intrinsic anabolic interventions, it is
 perfectible.
 The best studied downstream targets of Akt are mTOR and FOXO.

Based on p70-S6K divergence, it appears that GC causes Akt-mediated mTOR
 modulation, in contrast with denervation atrophy, where Akt is downstream

 However, an unreplicated recent study opens the perspective for a paradigm-over

 In an acute study of Dexa on female rates, Britto and colleagues confirmed
 most of the current model

 Dexa repressed mTORC1 activity, as indicated by lower phosphorylation of
 its substrate 4E-BP1.
 The repression of mTORC1 was correlated with an reduced inactivation of
 the negative regulator PRAS40.
 In contrast, and unexpectedly, acute Dexa increased TSC2 phosphorylation,
 indicating that Dexa induces substrate selectivity changes in Akt.
 As discussed earlier, such Akt selectivity are attributed to dissociation
 between Ser 473 and Thr 308 phosphorylation state.
 Indeed, Britto and colleagues found that, after acute Dexa, phosphorylation
 at Ser 473 increases, while at Thr 308 it decreases.
 This is a rare, although not unique, account of Akt hyperphosphorylation
 in GAML.
 In each case, these findings may be explained by the particular conditions
 of the unique experiment.
 Here, proteolysis was not unaltered, indicating that acute Dexa is not
 a true model of GAML.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Britto and colleagues refined their model by observing the effect of Dexa
 in REDD1 knockout mice.
 REDD1 depletion abolishes GAML, although atrogenes are still upregulated.
 On the other hand, REDD1 depletion prevents Dexa's hypophosphorylating
 action on 4E-BP1 and p70-S6K.
 These findings place mTORC1 inhibition at the core of GAML.
 Britto and colleagues propose a model of GAML where Ser 473 hyperphosphorylatio
n is caused by an mTORC1 feedback loop being severed by Dexa.
 Upstream of mTORC1, REDD1 knockout mice exhibit loss of phosphorylation
 on PRAS40 and Akt on Thr 308.
 While Akt remains upstream of mTOR and vital for GAML, Britto's model discards
 phosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 and of TSC2 from the rapid REDD1-dependent
 response to Dexa.
 Multiple studies in transformed cells confirm the role of Thr 308 in REDD1
 repressive action on mTOR, while proposing different intermediaries (

 Akt phosphorylates Foxo1 at Tyr 32 and Ser 253, thus creating binding sites

 Phosphorylated Foxo transcription factors are exported from the nucleus,

 It is believed that the Dexa-induced impairment of Akt contributes to an
 increase in their activity in GAML.
 Given that phosphorylated Foxo is degraded and is elicited by a low-activity

 1969 study on cortisone-induced atrophy of rat muscle brought one more
 important theme for the field of GAML.
 In that experiment, the specific activity, that is, the ratio between tracer
 and total protein, was the same in GC-treated muscle as in control animals,
 despite decreased muscle mass and decreased total tracer in the GC-treated
 group.
 Goldberg conjectured that an equal rate of protein synthesis in the two
 groups would have caused a faster dilution of the tracer in the GC-treated
 muscle.
 Failing to find that was interpreted as evidence for decreased protein
 synthesis in cortisone-treated muscle.
 This was an elegant way of bypassing the denominator effect from the typical
 experiments, where synthesis rate would be measured over hours, in muscles
 that already underwent atrophy in the prior days.
 In these cases, a loss in protein synthesis rate might be underestimated
 or even factored out, after normalization to a lower muscle mass.

 As described in the sections on Akt and mTOR, most of the knowledge we
 have about it is derived from studies of anabolism, where muscle, rather
 than being analyzed in its basal state, is first stimulated with insulin
 or IGF-I.
 In a sense, we know more about the interaction between Dexa and IGF-I than
 we know about Dexa alone.
 Lately, the interpretation of such experiments shifted from mechanism-explainin
g to a therapeutic paradigm.
 In mice, electroporation of IGF-I plasmid in tibialis protected solely
 the transformed fibers from Dexa-induced atrophy

 With these doses, Testo reliably reverses losses in body weight, muscle
 mass, and fiber CSA, induced by Dexa.
 At these doses, Testo co-administration exhibits a slight trend towards
 inferiority to basal levels.
 Molecular pathways largely confirm an Akt centered disruption of GAML.
 Muscle IGF-I expression is repressed by Dexa, and returned to basal level
 by Testo co-administration.
 Akt phosphorylation at Ser 473 follows a similar pattern, with Testo addition
 restoring what Dexa downregulates.
 Moreover, p70-S6K phosphorylation at Thr 389 and atrogenes correlate with
 Akt phosphorylation changes, indicating that Testo acts upstream of mTOR
 and Foxo.

 This study is focused on the anabolic-androgenic split, and therefore compares

 At these doses, Testo co-administration restores levator ani, but not other
 muscles.
 In levator ani, Testo co-administration upregulates IGF-I beyond basal
 levels, while in extraperitoneal muscles, IGF-I is only partially restored.
 Possibly as a consequence, Testo addition reduces atrogene expression to
 a larger extend in levator ani.
 In levator ani and C2C12 myotubes, Testo reverses losses of Akt (Ser 473),

 These changes point to a pleiotropic program through which AAS re-establish

.
 This suggests that in 7-day treated muscle autophagy must be downregulated,
 and goes against many other molecular markers that indicate the opposite.
 The example of Gadd45 illustrates the issues GAML research is confronted
 with.
 On one hand we have macroscopic certainties, such the loss of muscle mass
 following GC therapy, and its alleviation by Testo co-administration.
 On the other, we have invariable molecular correlates of Dexa treatment,
 such as augmented proteolysis, increased Foxo transcriptional activity,
 reduced insulin sensitivity at Akt and mTORC1 level, and upregulation of
 MuRF1 and REDD1.
 Most of these have been proven to mediate the macroscopic loss of muscle,
 but none is essential.
 The hierarchy of molecular events in GAML is unclear, and lags behind progresse
s made in the study of denervation atrophy.
 Transgenic whole-body experiments are needed, but GAML in the most common
 transgene model, the mouse, is understudied.
 We know little about mouse GAML.
 While some parallels with rat studies may help, differences in resistance
 to Dexa suggests there must be differences.
 Moreover, there is no published account of molecular mechanisms of interaction
 between AAS and GC in mice.
 This work sets out to determine whether AAS can alleviate GAML in mice.

Specific cDNA amounts were measured with an 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR cycler
 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California), using 96-well plates.
 Each unknown was measured in duplicates.
 Each well contained 1 uL total cDNA, 10 pmol each sense and anti-sense
 primer (listed later), and proprietary SybrGreen 2X.
 The qRT-PCR cycler incubates samples 2 minutes at 50Â°C, then 10 minutes
 at 95Â°C.
 Then, 40 cycles are run, comprising 15 seconds at 95Â°C and one minute at
 60Â°C, with measurements of DNA after each cycle.
 The amount of specific cDNA is estimated from the number of cycles required
 to reach a DNA threshold, automatically chosen by the Applied Biosystems
 software at midway between the lag phase and the end plateau DNA concentrations.
 Moreover, the Applied Biosystems software is able to interpolate the number
 of cycles, thus providing, for each well, a non-integer number of cycles
 that will yield the threshold DNA concentration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Duplicates were averaged for each unknown.
 Next, from the cycle count required to reach the threshold DNA concentration
 for the specific cDNA of interest, the cycle count for a housekeeping gene
 was subtracted, thus providing a relative measurement of expression for
 the gene of interest within the transcriptome of that animal.
 These measurements were further re-based, by subtracting from each the
 average measurement in the V group.

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the whole time course, I hypothesized that body weight changes
 and muscle atrophy occur in a gradual manner, with significant metabolic
 and molecular changes preceding the seven-day end of experiment.
 Accordingly, I repeated the above experiment on different cohorts of mice,
 which were sacrificed after only 1 or 3 days of treatment.
 Once more, absolute changes in body weight could not be correlated with
 the muscle changes (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Body-weight-at"

\end_inset

, left and middle).
 When normalized, relative changes in body weight for these groups of mice
 were less ample than those seen with 7 days of treatment, to the point
 that they were not statistically significant (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Time-course-of"

, bottom).
 These shorter treatments provided insight into the molecular development
 of atrophy, but, because they were run as independent experiments, they
 will not be analyzed in conjunction.

Body composition analysis indicated that all animals included in these experimen
ts progressively lost total water.
 There was no difference between water loss in the three experimental groups
 (Fig.

).
 This uniform loss of water negates a scenario in which the observations
 could be ascribed to increased water retention due to non-specific action
 of either steroid with MR.
 In all cases, the losses of total water track the loss of lean body mass,
 indicating that muscle atrophy, rather than renal dysfunction, underlies
 the loss of water.
 Fat mass analysis indicated that in the vehicle-alone treated group, the
 rate of apparent fat gain was essentially equal with the mass of injected
 vehicle accrued over the seven days.
 This demonstrates that experiments manipulations, in the absence of pharmacolog
ical treatments, have no effect on lipid metabolism.
 Dexa-treated groups accrued more fat (Dunn's test, vehicle vs.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
However muscle also has a characteristic pattern of amino acid metabolism:
 the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine are rapidly
 degraded as are other nonessential amino acids, including alanine, glutamate
 and aspartate.
 However unlike other tissues, muscle does not degrade the carbon skeletons
 of several other amino acids such as phenylalanine and tyrosine.
 Leucine is an important energy source for muscle tissue particularly during
 fasting, and under these conditions leucine inhibits oxidation of glucose.
 In muscle the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids is accelerated after
 injury or during fasting, and yields amino groups, which are used for synthesis
 of alanine (from pyruvate) and glutamine (from glutamate).
 The de novo synthesis of alanine and glutamine is coupled to degradation
 of the branched-chain amino acids, and alanine and glutamine are normally
 exported from muscle in much larger amounts than predicted simply from
 their occurrence in muscle protein.
 Alanine is avidly taken up by the liver and used for gluconeogenesis, but
 glutamine is an important energy source for cells such as leucocytes and

 Glutamate is central to all transamination reactions in muscle, and is
 one of the most abundant amino acids in proteins and in the free amino
 acid pool in skeletal muscle, but is present at a low concentration in
 plasma.

In humans, the techniques commonly used to estimate total protein turnover,
 or synthesis or degradation rates, include 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) excretion,
 amino acid balance studies and tracer studies employing infusion of stable
 isotopes of amino acids (13C, 2H or 15N).
 3-MH, acquires its methyl group after translation, is not re-utilised for
 protein synthesis or metabolised after release during proteolysis, and
 is excreted in the urine.
 As w90% of 3-MH residues are in

2010: The insulin-like growth factor-1 can block the transcriptional upregulatio
n of MuRF1 and MAFbx via the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt/Foxo pathway.
 MuRF1's substrates include several components of the sarcomeric thick filament,
 including myosin heavy chain.
 Thus, by blocking MuRF1, insulin-like growth factor-1 prevents the breakdown
 of the thick filament, particularly myosin heavy chain, which is asymmetrically
 lost in settings of cortisol-linked skeletal muscle atrophy.
 Insulin-like growth factor-1/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt signaling
 also dominantly inhibits the effects of myostatin, which is a member of
 the transforming growth factor-[beta] family of proteins.
 Deletion or inhibition of myostatin causes a significant increase in skeletal
 muscle size.
 Recently, myostatin has been shown to act both by inhibiting gene activation
 associated with differentiation, even when applied to postdifferentiated
 myotubes, and by blocking the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt pathway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While inactivation of myostatin leads to muscle growth in vivo, excess levels
 of myostatin induces cachectic-like muscle wasting.
 Molecular analyses reveal that excess levels of myostatin induce Atrogin-1
 expression by reducing Akt phosphorylation and thereby increasing FoxO1
 activity.

Ectopic overexpression of the eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3h and eIF3i subunits
 leads to transformation of cultured NIH-3T3 cells.
 This probably occurs through the stimulation of global protein synthesis,
 as well as increased translation efficiency of specific mRNAs that are
 normally poorly translated, including cyclin D1 (Ccnd1), Myc, ornithine
 decarboxylase 1 (Odc1) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The eIF4Eâ4E-BP complex might remain bound to the m7GpppN cap (as shown),
 possibly aiding the inhibition of cap-dependent mRNA translation owing
 to blockade of the mRNA 5â² end.
 Increased levels of hypophosphorylated 4E-BPs, in conjunction with elevated
 levels of eIF4G, can then function as a switch, as observed in certain
 locally advanced cancers, impairing the initiation of translation on purely
 cap-dependent mRNAs but enhancing translation of dual mechanism mRNAs that
 also contain an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to which eIF4G may

Muscle protein synthesis decreased 26% after exercise and was associated
 with a fourfold increase in the amount of eIF4E present in the inactive
 eIF4E â 4E-BP1 complex and a concomitant 71% decrease in the association
 of eIF4E with eIF4G.
 Refeeding the complete meal, but not the carbohydrate meal, increased muscle
 protein synthesis equal to controls, despite similar plasma concentrations
 of insulin.
 Additionally, eIF4E â 4E-BP1 association was inversely related and eIF4E
 â eIF4G association was positively correlated to muscle protein synthesis.

IGF-I/IGFBP-3 ameliorates alterations in protein synthesis, eIF4E availability,
 and myostatin in alcohol-fed rats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Alcohol decreased protein synthesis in WT mice, a change associated with
 less 4EBP1 phosphorylation, eIF4E-eIF4G binding, and raptor-4EBP1 binding,
 but greater mTOR-raptor complex formation.
 However, the content of eIF2Î± was not altered in muscle from alcohol-fed
 rats (Table 2).
 Furthermore, administration of IGF-I/IGFBP-3 did not alter the content
 eIF2Î± in either control or alcohol-fed rats.
 eIF-2Î± also undergoes reversible phosphorylation, and the extent of eIF2Î±
 phosphorylation is inversely proportional to changes in protein synthesis
 (33).
 However, there was also no change in the phosphorylation status of eIF2Î±
 in response to either alcohol feeding or the binary complex.
 These data suggest that effects of the binary complex on protein synthesis
 are independent of changes in eIF2Î± protein and phosphorylation state.

Women have less muscle than men but lose it more slowly during aging.
 To discover potential underlying mechanism(s) for this we evaluated the
 muscle protein synthesis process in postabsorptive conditions and during
 feeding in twenty-nine 65â80 year old men (n = 13) and women (n = 16).
 We discovered that the basal concentration of phosphorylated eEF2Thr56
 was ~40% less (P<0.05) and the basal rate of MPS was ~30% greater (P = 0.02)
 in women than in men; the basal concentrations of muscle phosphorylated
 AktThr308, p70s6kThr389, eIF4ESer209, and eIF4E-BP1Thr37/46 were not different
 between the sexes.
 Feeding increased (P<0.05) AktThr308 and p70s6kThr389 phosphorylation to
 the same extent in men and women but increased (P<0.05) the phosphorylation
 of eIF4ESer209 and eIF4E-BP1Thr37/46 in men only.
 Accordingly, feeding increased MPS in men (P<0.01) but not in women.

The atrophic effect of testosterone (T) deprivation and the opposite, rescuing,
 effect of T administration on muscle mass are induced by a multitude of
 cellular mediators, in accordance with Tâs pleiotropic nature.
 Earlier findings show that at least part of its effect is at the level
 of protein translation1.
 We hypothesize that T regulates protein translation, in both non-specific
 (cap-dependent initiation, elongation factors, ribosomal recycling) and
 specific manners (internal ribosome entry site).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The effects of T are typically observed only at organism level, at which
 a distinction between these concurrent regulatory pathways is difficult
 to make.
 In order to determine changes in the non-specific regulation of translation,
 we will determine changes of pattern in the proteins that associate with
 polysomes in vivo, as an effect of testosterone deprivation and/or testosterone
 treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A required initial step is the isolation of translating mRNAs (polysomes)
 and of ribosome-free mRNAs.
 We will obtain specimens of levator ani, a slow-twitching muscle, from
 male mice that underwent castration, with or without T treatment.
 The castration effects will be observed at 14 days after surgery or sham
 intervention, while testosteroneâs effect will be observed after 7 days
 of treatment.
 The muscle polysomes will be isolated from levator ani, obtained by necropsy
 from 3 animals for each experimental condition.
 The resulting sample size is comparable to that used in similar earlier
 experiments, 50 mg2.
 Cells will be lysed in the presence of 0.1 g/L cycloheximide (blocks peptide
 elongation, locking the translating ribosomes in place), 1 g/L heparin
 or other RNAse inhibitor (Protector), 0.5 mM DTT (maintains cytosol-like
 reductive environment), 5 mM Mg2+ (stabilizes mRNA structures), in addition
 to regular lysis buffer, and lysed by the standard procedure (incubation
 with Triton).
 The lysate will be precleared by gentle centrifugation, as 12000g, recommended
 by Arava3, might lead to microsomal loss, favoring mRNA for soluble proteins.
 The sucrose gradient will be obtained as described3, comprising the interval
 10-50% sucrose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For further analysis, we will pool the fractions as follows: the first fractions
, lighter than 40S subunits, will constitute the ribosome-free mRNAs pool;
 the latter group of peaks, after 80S, will include translated mRNAs pool.
 The distinction between monoribosomal mRNAâs and polyribosomal mRNAâs is
 of reduced theoretical importance, and will be technically challenging,
 according to Arava3.
 Also, the 43S sub-peak, consisting of mRNAâs that are stalled at initiation,
 will be difficult to purify, and relatively difficult to use in a comparison,
 because the counterpart, the translating mRNA pool, will also contain similarly
 stalled ribosomes.
 A comparison between 43S (or 48S) initiating complexes and translating
 ribosomes would be possible by using larger specimens, by using a less
 steep gradient, e.g.
 10-30%, or by using an apparatus similar to that presented by Esposito
 et al.4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At this time, we should be able to confirm earlier observations, by determining
 differences in the ratio translated-to-untranslated mRNA, which can be
 quantified by qPCR in the two pools with olygo-T primers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To determine non-specific regulatory mechanisms acting on protein translation
 as an effect of T treatment, we will compare the proteins in the translating
 mRNAâs fraction between treatments.
 We will approach the problem in two ways, without and with a priori knowledge.
 In the former approach, we will perform mass spectroscopy studies on the
 proteins of the translating ribosome pool, in which case we expect to find
 quantitative and/or qualitative (PTM) differences in the presence and absence
 of T.
 In the latter approach, we will quantify by immunoblot and densitometry
 the following proteins:

To determine effect of T on translation of specific mRNAs, the same two
 approaches can be taken.
 The approach without a priori knowledge will consist in the microarray
 analysis comparing translating-to-untranslated ratios of mRNA between presence
 and absence of T.
 The informed approach will involve the same type of comparisons by qPCR
 or densitometric Northern blot for the mRNAs that were found to be regulated
 by T in the microarray and/or any protein which is known to be regulated
 by T (e.g., atrogin).

* Calculate number of ribosomes per fraction through the A254 curve, counting
 the peaks.
 For the fractions where resolution is not good (many ribosomes per messenger),
 a logarithmic extrapolation can be used (see Arava, 2002).
 The extrapolation may be confirmed by cleavage of specific genes followed
 by northern for the ribosomes on that region (unclear, but mentioned by
 Arava, 2002).
 Use qPCR for the messenger of interest to determine the amount of messenger
 per fraction.
 Arava suggests using the peak fraction as indicative of number of ribosomes
 per messenger, while Lacsina (2011) uses the qPCR results from each fraction
 and calculates an weighted average of ribosomes per specific messenger.
 From these two numbers, one get number of ribosomes per mRNA molecule.
 Using ORF size, one can calculate average distance between ribosomes on
 specific mRNAs.
